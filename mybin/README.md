Scripts I use for fun and efficiency
========================================================
+ **addpyhead.py**

    adds a python header to previously created python files in the current directory
+ **addpysg.py**

    This command adds a python shebang to all the python files in the current directory.
- **mycmds.py**

    This command lists all the custom commnads and their description.
+ **newpy.py**

    To create a new python file with permissions and header(Author information, Date, Python_Version, Shebang, Description) set.
+ **pyexec.py**

    Change the permissions of all python files to executable in the current directory.
+ **python2a.py**
 
   Start the preinstalled mac python2 as I've installed anaconda and cannot run the original directly. PS I know I could have written just /usr/bin/python but just for experimenting sake created a 2 line script for that.
