# Projects
Here I'll be adding my personal projects

These are my personal projests and codes from some online courses that I completed.

1. Udacity CS212 is an introductory course on python that introdues you to basic concepts of OOP using python with fun examples. I do recommend you to see the alphabet project from this course its very interesting.
