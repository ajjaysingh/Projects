[91m        SHORT  No one likes being called naive, since it means you lack sophistication or street smarts.[0m
[36m         LONG  A person who is too trusting can be criticized for being overly naive: "You're so naive, you think that e-mail from the Nigerian prince is really going to
               make you a million dollars!" Naive shares the same root as native, and originally meant "natural" or "not artificial." It can still be used in
               a more positive meaning when describing a charming lack of artificiality, as in "the naive style of folk art made by an untrained painter."[0m
