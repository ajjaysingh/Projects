[91m        SHORT  Paganism refers to religions other than Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Any religion that’s outside of the mainstream is considered paganism. Wiccans and
               Druids are but a few of the people who practice paganism, but many pagan religions have been retired.[0m
[36m         LONG  Paganism is a loose term that lumps together many religions and belief systems. This term was often used in a derogatory way — especially by Christians — for
               faiths that existed before Jesus. The term pagan is related to the Latin word for “rural” because country people held on to the old religions
               for longer. In paganism, polytheism — a group of gods — was more common than the monotheism that followed. Paganism is also called heathenism.[0m
