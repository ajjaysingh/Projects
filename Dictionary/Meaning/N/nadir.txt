[91m        SHORT  If a highly forgetful person loses his phone, his wallet, and then his car keys in separate instances all in one day, you could say that he has reached an
               organizational nadir. This means “lowest point.”[0m
[36m         LONG  This was originally strictly an astronomical term and is the opposite of the word zenith, which is the part of the sky located directly above a person’s head
               or, “high point.”  In fact, nadir is derived from the Arabic nazir, which means “opposite to.” It is still used in astronomy to indicate the
               part of the celestial sphere located directly below an observer, but also more generally to describe the worst point of someone’s life or
               career.[0m
