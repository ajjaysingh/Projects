[91m        SHORT  If you're one of those people who believe there's nothing worth believing in, your doctrine is nihilism. In philosophy, nihilism is the complete rejection of
               moral values and religious beliefs.[0m
[36m         LONG  It is such a negative outlook that it denies any meaning or purpose in life. In political theory, nihilism is carried to an even greater extreme, arguing for
               the destruction of all existing political and social institutions. The term nihilism was borrowed from German Nihilismus, since the doctrine
               was developed by the German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi. The German word is formed from Latin nihil "nothing" plus the suffix –ismus "a
               doctrine or theory."[0m
