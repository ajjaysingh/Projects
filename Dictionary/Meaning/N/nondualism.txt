[91m        SHORT  Vandalism is the destruction of someone else's property. Some people think of graffiti as public art, while others dismiss it as nothing but vandalism.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you damage public or private property on purpose, you've committed the crime of vandalism. The range of vandalism can vary from carving your initials in a
               desk at school to tearing pages out of a library book to breaking windows of a building. The word vandal comes from the Vandals, the Germanic
               tribe that attacked Rome in 455. The tribe's name meant "wanderer," but the word vandal was used in the 1600s to mean "destroyer of what is
               beautiful."[0m
