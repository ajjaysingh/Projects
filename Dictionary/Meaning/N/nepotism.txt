[91m        SHORT  Nepotism is the practice of favoritism based on kinship, like when the coach chooses his own kid to be the quarterback even if his kid stinks at football.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word nepotism comes from the Italian word for nephew, nepote. Apparently back in the 17th century a lot of people tended to promote their nephews to
               powerful positions at the expense of other candidates. Nepotism has come to mean favoritism of any family member, so if you‚Äôre the daughter of
               a powerful CEO, don‚Äôt worry, you can still be the beneficiary of nepotism. However, people might not like you when you become the Vice
               President, unless you‚Äôve really earned the title.[0m
