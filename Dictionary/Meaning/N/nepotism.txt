                                                                                     NEPOTISM                                                                                     
  SHORT        Nepotism is the practice of favoritism based on kinship, like when the coach chooses his own kid to be the quarterback even if his kid stinks at football.
  LONG         The word nepotism comes from the Italian word for nephew, nepote. Apparently back in the 17th century a lot of people tended to promote their nephews to
               powerful positions at the expense of other candidates. Nepotism has come to mean favoritism of any family member, so if you’re the daughter of
               a powerful CEO, don’t worry, you can still be the beneficiary of nepotism. However, people might not like you when you become the Vice
               President, unless you’ve really earned the title.

     >         “The transition seems well planned and on track, despite the fact that allegations of nepotism and conflicts of interest will hamper him constantly.”
     >         Her husband is trying to find away around nepotism laws that prevent him from working in the White House.
     >         In 1977, concerns of nepotism were raised when TV presenter and Times economics columnist Peter Jay became the UK's ambassador in Washington.
     >         Frankly, I think the nepotism law that may bar Kushner from working with Trump in the White House is ridiculous.
     >         Also in the basket of worries about temperament: Trump’s heedlessness to issues of conflict of interest and nepotism.
