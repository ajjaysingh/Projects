[91m        SHORT  If you have a notion that you can swim across the ocean, you are probably wrong. A notion is an idea, often vague and sometimes fanciful.[0m
[36m         LONG  A notion is lighter than a theory and embraces a whimsy that a simple idea never could. You might have the notion that you can slow global warming by taking
               public transportation and reusing plastic bags. If you share a far-fetched idea with others, someone might respond with a "Where'd you get that
               notion?!" Notions can also refer to the buttons, thread, zippers, and pins necessary for sewing things. So if you have a notion to create your
               own Halloween costume, you better pick up some notions from the craft store.[0m
