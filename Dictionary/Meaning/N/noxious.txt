[91m        SHORT  Something noxious is harmful and could be even fatal ‚Äî whether it is colorless, odorless, and invisible like carbon monoxide, or dark, strong-smelling, and
               obvious, like black smoke from a fire. People are called noxious too when they hurt others with cruelty or mental anguish.[0m
[36m         LONG  English and Latin roots for noxious are related to the meanings of "harm," "damage," and "injury." While obnoxious might come to mind when seeing the word
               noxious, obnoxious is a much less damaging adjective to describe someone annoying. Most uses for noxious involve real physical or emotional
               damage unless the word is used in exaggeration. Examples range from "the noxious gas fumes made the dog pass out" to "his cologne was so
               noxious I had to exit the elevator and take the stairs."[0m
