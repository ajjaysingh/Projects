[91m        SHORT  A nip is a tiny bite, a cold feeling, or a strong taste on your tongue. It‚Äôs also a verb for pinching or biting something, but not always in a bad way.[0m
[36m         LONG  Being nipped now and then isn‚Äôt a big deal. If a puppy nips your finger, no worries. The cold morning nip when you get out of bed is uncomfortable, but put on
               socks and you‚Äôre fine. Nipping can be a good thing sometimes, like in the phrase ‚Äúnip it in the bud,‚Äù which means stopping a poor behavior or
               activity when it first starts. A nip can also mean a small sip of something, like hot chocolate ‚Äî which is a good idea if you‚Äôre feeling a nip
               of a cold draft.[0m
