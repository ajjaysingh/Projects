[36m         LONG  Someone who is a nihilist is a believer of nihilism which literally means "nothingism." They believe in nothing, maintaining that life has no meaning and
               rejecting all moral and religious values as well as political and social institutions. A movie in which human beings are shown as fundamentally
               evil creatures doomed to fail might be said to have nihilist themes.[0m
