[91m        SHORT  A nub is a little piece of something, especially one that sticks out. The raised rubber buttons on your TV remote control are nubs.[0m
[36m         LONG  Tiny lumps or bits are nubs, like the nubs on tree branches that will become buds in the spring, or the nubs on a crocheted blanket, little woven bumps.
               Another kind of nub is the heart or essence of something: one incriminating piece of evidence might be the nub of a judge's decision in a case.
               The "lump" meaning is older, stemming from knob, while the "essence" meaning dates from the nineteenth century.[0m
