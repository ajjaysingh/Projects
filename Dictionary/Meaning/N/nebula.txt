[91m        SHORT  A nebula is a massive cloud of gas and dust in outer space. A nebula is sometimes the birthplace of stars, such as the Orion Nebula where new stars ‚Äî a
               youthful million years old ‚Äî are still forming.[0m
[36m         LONG  Another example of a nebula is the Crab Nebula ‚Äî the glowing result of a supernova, noted by Chinese astronomers in 1054 CE. It spans about 10 light-years in
               length. In biology, a nebula may be a cloudy formation in the eye, or a cloudiness of urine. It also refers to a medicinal preparation put in a
               nebulizer. When you are talking about more than one nebula (which is probably not that often for the average person), say nebulae.[0m
