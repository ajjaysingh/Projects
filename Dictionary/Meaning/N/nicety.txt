[91m        SHORT  Clearly, you're interested in the nicety of a word's meaning if you're checking out this website. A nicety is a fine detail or shade of meaning that anything
               ‚Äî not just a word ‚Äî can possess.[0m
[36m         LONG  Even the word nicety has niceties. The emphasis on detail can also refer to a precision or accuracy of sorts; if someone has judged something "to a nicety,"
               they've judged it exactly. Yet another common meaning is in the sense of a minor aspect of polite behavior. Washing your hands before dinner is
               a "social nicety." So is covering your mouth when you cough. Now where would we be without niceties?[0m
