[91m        SHORT  If your friend is acting cool, unconcerned or in an indifferent manner, call him nonchalant ‚Äî like when he saunters by a group of whispering, giggling girls
               and just nods and says, "Hey."[0m
[36m         LONG  If you act nonchalant, you are literally acting cool, as nonchalant traces back to non- "not" and Latin calƒìre "to be warm." Isn't that cool? Sometimes, a
               nonchalant person acts indifferent or uninterested, but really cares very much. If you give a girl a nonchalant smile, you definitely want her
               to notice you! Even though it begins with non, nonchalant has no positive form ‚Äî  chalant is not a word.[0m
