[91m        SHORT  Sometimes you just need a little nudge or slight push to get your day going. It might be a coffee, or your favorite song, or your mom stripping the covers and
               standing over your bed.  Take your pick.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some people believe the word nudge comes from the Norwegian dialect nugga meaning "to push, rub." This makes sense, since a nudge is a push of sorts. But it's
               more of a gentle push. Think of nudging coals around in a fire or a crowd of people nudging to the stage at a concert.  When you gently annoy
               your husband so he'll mow the lawn, you're nudging him along.[0m
