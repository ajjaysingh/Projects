  SHORT        Sometimes you just need a little nudge or slight push to get your day going. It might be a coffee, or your favorite song, or your mom stripping the covers and
               standing over your bed.  Take your pick.
  LONG         Some people believe the word nudge comes from the Norwegian dialect nugga meaning "to push, rub." This makes sense, since a nudge is a push of sorts. But it's
               more of a gentle push. Think of nudging coals around in a fire or a crowd of people nudging to the stage at a concert.  When you gently annoy
               your husband so he'll mow the lawn, you're nudging him along.
