  SHORT        When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective imperative.
  LONG         Imperative is from Latin imperare "to command," and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: "Do it!" is an imperative sentence. It's still
               used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: "Hiring new workers has become imperative."  It
               has more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent.
