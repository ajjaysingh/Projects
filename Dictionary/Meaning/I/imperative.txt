[36m         LONG  Imperative is from Latin imperare "to command," and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: "Do it!" is an imperative sentence. It's still
               used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: "Hiring new workers has become imperative."  It
               has more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent.[0m
