[91m        SHORT  The adjective impeccable describes something or someone without any flaws. A stand-up comedian needs  impeccable timing for his jokes to work.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective impeccable refers to something or someone without marking or error ‚Äî but it can also mean to be spotless or clean. The word comes from the Latin
               impeccabilis and means "to be sinless," which is also one of the senses, now outdated, in English. You can see how "clean" comes from
               "sinless." Because of the messy nature of picnic food, it is highly unlikely that you would leave with your clothing still as impeccable as
               when you arrived, especially if you like mustard and ketchup![0m
