[91m        SHORT  Though it might be more fun if it meant "canning peaches for the winter," impeachment is actually a formal document accusing a public official with
               misconduct.[0m
[36m         LONG  The United States Constitution gives the legislative branch the power of impeachment, that is, to press formal charges of misconduct against a sitting
               president. The House of Representatives makes the formal charges, and the trial is held in the Senate. A two-thirds majority of the Senate is
               required for a conviction. Two United States presidents ‚Äî Andrew Johnson and William Clinton ‚Äî have been impeached. Neither was convicted.
               Other federal officials, like judges, can also be impeached.[0m
