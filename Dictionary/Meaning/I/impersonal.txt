[91m        SHORT  If you're impersonal, you're neutral ‚Äî you're not showing your feelings or your preference. If you choose people to be on your team by closing your eyes and
               pointing, that's impersonal ‚Äî you're not picking your friends or the best players.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impersonal can be good. An impersonal rejection is easier to take than one that specifies precisely why you, in particular, are a reject. But if your class is
               so impersonal, your teacher doesn't even know your name, that‚Äôs not good. A wedding that doesn't include details about the bride and groom
               would be impersonal and maybe more like a business meeting than a celebration. Impersonal comes from the Latin roots in- (or im-), "not," and
               personalis, "of a person."[0m
