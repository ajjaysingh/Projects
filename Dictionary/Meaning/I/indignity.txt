[36m         LONG  As you might guess from that negative prefix in-, an indignity is a word that takes dignity (or self-esteem) away. If you find a fly in your soup, that's an
               indignity ‚Äî not to mention protein. If you're making a speech and you realize your fly is open, that's a major indignity. Many people find
               waiting in line a long time to be an indignity. When you say "This is an indignity!" you're really saying, "I'm better than this, and I
               shouldn't have to deal with it." Needless to say, life is full of indignities.[0m
