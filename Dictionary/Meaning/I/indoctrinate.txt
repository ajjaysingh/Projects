[91m        SHORT  If you indoctrinate someone, you teach that person a one-sided view of something and ignore or dismiss opinions that don‚Äôt agree with your view. Cults,
               political entities, and even fans of particular sports teams are often said to indoctrinate their followers.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you indoctrinate someone, the goal is to have that person follow a particular set of beliefs (or a doctrine), rather than being able to think independently
               or know right from wrong. For example, a child may be indoctrinated into a life of violence by growing up in a war-torn region, or a student
               may be indoctrinated into a life as a Marxist by an influential political science professor.[0m
