                                                                                       ILK                                                                                        
  SHORT        Ilk is a certain type of person, usually a type you don't care for. The word is used in sentences like "I'm tired of you and your ilk!
  LONG         When you say "you and your ilk," you mean "you and everyone just like you." And that's not usually meant in a nice way. You probably wouldn't talk about
               Nelson Mandela and his ilk — ilk sounds negative. Usually, you're talking about a criminal and his ilk, or a crooked politician and his ilk. If
               someone is talking about your ilk, it might be time to get new friends or change your ways.

     >         “I think Romney and his ilk are smart enough to see that there is something going on here.”
     >         And then there are the pent-up resentments against a liberal intellectual and media establishment that scorned his ilk for years.
     >         Bannon’s ilk sees a woman on a quest for dignity and equality and wants to irradiate it out of her.
     >         In other words, this tweet, in its tone and substance, is uncharacteristic—and for that reason, many of his ilk are taking it seriously.
     >         Mr. Paladino and his ilk have poisoned the minds of our young people and scared others.
