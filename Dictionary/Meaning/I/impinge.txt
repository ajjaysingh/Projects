[91m        SHORT  Whether you have a habit of standing too close when talking to others or bringing luggage on a crowded rush-hour subway car, you'll find people don't like it

[36m         LONG  When you impinge, you intrude on something, whether it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs space, time, or rights. Think of it as moving in on someone‚Äôs territory. The word also
               can be used in the sense of affecting something, usually negatively, often by restricting it. For example, constantly inviting your friend to
               go shopping and meet you in nice restaurants might impinge on her desire to save money.[0m
