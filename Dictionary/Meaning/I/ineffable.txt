[91m        SHORT  When you find something hard to express or difficult to pin down, it's ineffable. The feeling when you get a new puppy is ineffable ‚Äî too strange and
               wonderful to define.[0m
[36m         LONG  You could call something "indescribable", but it wouldn't be quite the same as calling it ineffable. An ineffable feeling, for example, has an almost ghostly
               quality. You can almost touch it, but it slips away just before you do. The bubbles in a glass of champagne have an ineffable joy to them. The
               sense of sadness that you feel watching certain TV commercials is often ineffable: you simply can't explain it. You know that strange feeling
               of satisfaction you feel when you learn a new word? That's an ineffable feeling.[0m
