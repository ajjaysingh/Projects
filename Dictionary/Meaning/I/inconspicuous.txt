[91m        SHORT  Inconspicuous describes something that doesn't stand out or attract attention. The bad news? You just got pizza sauce on your shirt. The good news? It landed
               in an inconspicuous spot, so no one will notice.[0m
[36m         LONG  Inconspicuous comes from the Latin word inconspicuus, or "not visible," and the original meaning of inconspicuous was "invisible," until around 1828. Today,
               it describes anything that blends in or isn't very noticeable. If you have ever tried to find your black luggage among all the other pieces of
               black luggage at the airport, you know that sometimes, being inconspicuous makes things harder.[0m
