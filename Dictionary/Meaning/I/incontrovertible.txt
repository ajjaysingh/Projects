[91m        SHORT  When something is incontrovertible, it is undeniably, absolutely, 100 percent, completely true. That rain is wet is an incontrovertible fact.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you look at incontrovertible, you see that -controver-, as in controversy, is hiding inside. Add in the prefix, and it's easy to see that incontrovertible
               means there is no controversy about something, or, in other words, it is unchangeable and true.  Incontrovertible evidence or proof is what you
               are looking for if you suspect that someone is doing something wrong.[0m
