[91m        SHORT  An inquest is when a court of law or a coroner investigates the circumstances of a person's death. If a person in your family dies suddenly, you might attend
               an inquest at the courthouse.[0m
[36m         LONG  A death doesn't always require an inquest ‚Äî they are typically carried out when there is something unexplained or suspicious about the way someone died. The
               inquest might be a step before a murder investigation, for example. Like a trial, a court inquest typically has a verdict issued by a judge,
               which might be "natural death" or "accidental death." The Old French root word is enqueste, or "inquiry."[0m
