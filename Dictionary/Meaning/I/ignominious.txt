[91m        SHORT  Losing a football game stinks, but losing a game where, at the end, you are lying face down in a puddle of mud and the fans are burning effigies of you in the
               streets? That is an ignominious defeat.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although ignominious can modify other words, it is nearly always attached to "defeat." It derives from the word ignominy, which means public shame or defeat.
               Ignominy derives from the Latin in- "not" + a variant of nomen "name."[0m
