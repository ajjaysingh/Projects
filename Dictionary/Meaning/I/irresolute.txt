[91m        SHORT  Irresolute describes someone who feels stuck. A decision must be made, a plan acted on, but the irresolute person just doesn't know what to do.[0m
[36m         LONG  Resolute describes certainty. When someone is resolute, things get done: plans are made and carried out. But add the prefix ir to resolute and you get its
               opposite. An irresolute person isn't necessarily a slacker ‚Äî he or she just doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's confusion. Maybe it's a matter
               of waiting for better information to come along. Either way, if someone is irresolute, you'll need to be patient ‚Äî or willing to nudge him or
               her into action.[0m
