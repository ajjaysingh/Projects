[91m        SHORT  The verb indite, rarely used today, means "compose" or "put down in writing," like when you find a quiet place to sit down with your notebook and pen and
               indite a journal entry or a first draft of a short story.[0m
[36m         LONG  To indite is to write something creative ‚Äî you indite a letter, and jot a grocery list. Don't confuse indite with its homophone indict, which means "to charge
               with a crime." Both come from the Latin word dictare, meaning ‚Äúto declare.‚Äù Even if you indite a really bad poem, critics won't indict you.[0m
