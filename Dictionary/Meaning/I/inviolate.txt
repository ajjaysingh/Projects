[91m        SHORT  If something‚Äôs inviolate, it‚Äôs sacred and must be protected. If you make an inviolate promise to your sister to never reveal her secret superhero identity,
               it's one you must honor and take very seriously.[0m
[36m         LONG  Inviolate comes from the Latin word inviolatus, made up of in-, meaning ‚Äúnot‚Äù and violare, meaning ‚Äúviolate.‚Äù So inviolate describes something so sacred or
               pure that it must not be violated. It can be used to describe fundamental principles or rights, such as the inviolate right of free speech, but
               it can also describe things that must be kept safe and pure. You might believe that the natural coastline outside your city should remain
               inviolate and not be developed.[0m
