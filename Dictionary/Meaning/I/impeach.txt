[91m        SHORT  Impeach means to charge someone with doing something wrong, specifically a high government official, such as the US president, a senator, or a Federal judge.
               Fortunately, very few presidents have had the dishonor of being impeached.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impeach comes from the Latin impedicare "catch, entangle." If you can remember that impeach is closely related to impede, which means to slow or hinder, all
               you have to think of is, "Stop, thief!" to remember that impeach has to do with crime and not with stone fruit.[0m
