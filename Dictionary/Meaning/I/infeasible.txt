[91m        SHORT  Infeasible things are impossible, or too complicated to actually be done. Your idea of staging a city-wide game of Capture the Flag is probably infeasible.[0m
[36m         LONG  After several frustrating attempts at walking your cat around the neighborhood on a leash, you might finally decide the idea is infeasible ‚Äî it's just not
               going to work the way you imagined. When something is feasible, it's entirely possible. Feasible comes from the Old French faisable, "that may
               be done," from the Latin root facere, "to make or do." When you add the "not" prefix in-, you get infeasible.[0m
