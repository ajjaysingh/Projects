[91m        SHORT  Inadvertently is an adverb that means "without knowledge or intent," like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom because it looks
               just like yours.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it — you might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at home, or hurt your
               friend's feelings. Some things that happen inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For example,  if you just happen to
               park your car at the exact place that blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a life.[0m
