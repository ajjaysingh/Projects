[91m        SHORT  If someone's rude without being openly nasty, like a kid in the back row of class quietly heckling his teacher, you can call him impertinent.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impertinent originally meant just what it sounds like, "not pertinent, irrelevant," but it also came to mean "inappropriate, out of place" and therefore
               "intrusive, presumptuous; behaving without proper respect; insolent." It still carries a condescending air, so it's best used of or to a child
               being snippy to a grownup: "Don't be impertinent!" The stress is on the second syllable: im-PERT-inent.[0m
