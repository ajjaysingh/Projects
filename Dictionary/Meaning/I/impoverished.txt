[91m        SHORT  Impoverished describes being really, really poor, either from having no money or being in bad health.  A person who lives on the street is impoverished, and a
               country may become impoverished after a devastating war.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impoverished comes from the Old French word povre, which means ‚Äúpoor,‚Äù and you can almost see the word poverty inside impoverished.  Living an impoverished
               life means that your finances and health are not in good shape, and in fact you could die because you can‚Äôt support yourself.  A corrupt and
               greedy government makes its citizens impoverished, and too much pollution will create impoverished soil that isn‚Äôt healthy enough to grow
               delicious vegetables.[0m
