[91m        SHORT  Whether you’re referring to someone else’s downfall, to your fate, or to the sunrise, you can use the noun inevitability to say that something is just bound
               to happen.[0m
[36m         LONG  Inevitability is related to the Latin word evitare, meaning “avoid.” When you add on the prefix in-, meaning “not,” and the noun suffix -ity at the end, you
               come up with something that has the quality of being unavoidable. Inevitability is most often used to describe unavoidable grim things — like
               “the inevitability of disaster” or “the inevitability of war,” but it can also be used for more light-hearted purposes as well. Think about the
               inevitability of happy endings in most fairy tales.[0m
