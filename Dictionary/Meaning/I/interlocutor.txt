[91m        SHORT  An interlocutor is someone who participates in a discussion or conversation, sometimes as a go-between. If you and your friend are in an argument and aren't
               speaking, a third friend could act as an interlocutor, delivering messages back and forth.[0m
[36m         LONG  Interlocutor traces back to the Latin word interloqui, meaning ‚Äúto speak between.‚Äù We use interlocutor either for "a conversation partner," or for "a third
               party in a conversation," like a middleman who speaks on behalf of an organization. It's also an old term for the guy in a minstrel show who
               questions all the other performers as a way of moving the act forward. "What's that you say? A funky dance? Go on and show us then."[0m
