  SHORT        An interlocutor is someone who participates in a discussion or conversation, sometimes as a go-between. If you and your friend are in an argument and aren't
               speaking, a third friend could act as an interlocutor, delivering messages back and forth.

               party in a conversation," like a middleman who speaks on behalf of an organization. It's also an old term for the guy in a minstrel show who
               questions all the other performers as a way of moving the act forward. "What's that you say? A funky dance? Go on and show us then."
