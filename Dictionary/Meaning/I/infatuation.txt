[91m        SHORT  Infatuation is falling in love with or becoming extremely interested in someone or something for a short time. If you have an infatuation with a particular
               singer, you probably listen to her on repeat all day long, at least this week.[0m
[36m         LONG  If something infatuates you, it has caused you to become foolish. We say you have an infatuation when you express a crazy, extreme love of something––a
               person, a style, a band, anything. Infatuations usually don’t last. Like incredibly intense crushes or the stomach flu, infatuations come on
               strong and then get forgotten.[0m
