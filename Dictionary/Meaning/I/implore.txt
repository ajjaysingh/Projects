[91m        SHORT  You might ask your friend for a loan if you're short a few bucks, but if the bank is about to foreclose on your house you'll implore your friend for the

[36m         LONG  The word implore is often used to describe an urgent request made out of desperation. A man on death row might implore the governor to grant him a last-minute
               pardon. In the old days, you might have heard the word spoken by someone with lousy aim at a duel ‚Äî "I implore you not to shoot me, my good
               man!" Today, this first-person use of the word sounds old-fashioned, although you might still hear it in a period drama.[0m
