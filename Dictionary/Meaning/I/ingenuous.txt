[91m        SHORT  Someone who is ingenuous shows a childlike innocence, trust, and openness. One of the things kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while
               they're still relatively ingenuous‚Äì‚Äìtheir open, trusting natures are a joy.[0m
[36m         LONG  A near synonym is naive. Its opposite is disingenuous, which means "giving a false impression of being honest and sincere." Don't confuse the word ingenuous
               with the similarly spelled ingenious, which means "very smart or clever." Ingenuous is from Latin ingenuus "having the qualities of people born
               free, noble, honest, open," ultimately formed from the prefix in- "in" plus gignere "to produce."[0m
