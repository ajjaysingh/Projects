[91m        SHORT  An inferno is a huge fire that's difficult to control, like an inferno that burns down a whole city block. Inferno also can describe any horrible place where
               people suffer.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin word infernus means "of the lower regions."  Using inferno to mean "hell" is credited to medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Dante's epic poem
               the Divine Comedy contains one part titled The Inferno, which tells of a journey through the nine circles of hell full of torture, pain, and
               imagery of red ‚Äî flames, boiling blood, and so on.[0m
