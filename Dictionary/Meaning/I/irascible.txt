[36m         LONG  Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means "anger" or "rage," the same root that gives us  the word ire, "anger." The -sc in the middle of
               irascible, means "becoming," so irascible doesn't just mean you're angry ‚Äî it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of
               the time, then you're irascible ‚Äî ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire.[0m
