[91m        SHORT  Indoctrination means teaching someone to accept a set of beliefs without questioning them. Your sister's orientation at her new job might seem more like

[36m         LONG  Indoctrination often refers to religious ideas, when you're talking about a religious environment that doesn't let you question or criticize those beliefs.
               The Latin word for "teach," doctrina is the root of indoctrinate, and originally that's just what it meant. By the 1830s it came to mean the
               act of forcing ideas and opinions on someone who isn't allowed to question them.[0m
