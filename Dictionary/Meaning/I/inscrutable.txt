[91m        SHORT  Any person or thing that's mysterious, mystifying, hard to read, or impossible to interpret is inscrutable. You ever notice how it's hard to tell what some
               people are thinking? Those folks are inscrutable.[0m
[36m         LONG  A good way to think about what inscrutable means is to consider cats and dogs. Dogs wear their hearts on their sleeves, shaking when they're afraid and
               bouncing up and down when they're happy. Dogs are definitely not inscrutable, because you can tell what they're thinking and feeling. On the
               other hand, cats are very difficult to read. Even longtime cat owners aren't always sure what's going on with their kitty. Cats are very
               inscrutable animals.[0m
