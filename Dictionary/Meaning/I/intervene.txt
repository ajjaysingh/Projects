                                                                                    INTERVENE                                                                                     
  SHORT        From the Latin "intervenire," meaning “to come between,” the verb intervene means just that: to get involved, to jump in the middle of something, to
               interfere.
  LONG         The verb intervene was first recorded around 1600. Since then there haven't been many interventions in its meaning or usage. You should probably intervene in
               a heated verbal fight between two of your friends before it escalates and gets physical. Especially if they're debating the United States’
               habit of intervening in international conflicts.

     >         This call has grown into a clamor in the intervening six years.
     >         The words “notice” and “not” reflect each other more vividly without the hard stop of the intervening question mark.
     >         "The air force intervened, targeted the vehicle the gunmen were in and hit and struck the vehicle, killing what seems as four terrorists," Lerner said.
     >         But fate intervened when Quick injured his groin in the season opener and Zat-koff twice experienced groin problems.
     >         The idea is to intervene early, to prevent further trauma or negative impacts down the road.
