[91m        SHORT  The most common example of an infusion you are likely to encounter in your daily life is your morning cup of coffee. An infusion is the creation of a new
               substance by steeping another substance in a liquid, usually water.[0m
[36m         LONG  Infusion is often misused with transfusion, which has a slightly different meaning.  A transfusion, as in a blood transfusion, is the simple addition of one
               substance to another, without the creation of something new. But a drip feed of medicine, for example, is technically an infusion as it alters
               the state of the blood. See, you‚Äôre halfway to becoming a doctor (or at least a linguist) simply by reading this site.[0m
