[36m         LONG  Some prefer their musical idols to be insouciant, seeming not to care what their fans think or want. Others like them more eager to please, happy to take

               participate, while Davis was the insouciant master who showed no concern for or interest in what his listeners might prefer: some people found
               his insouciant manner irresistible.[0m
