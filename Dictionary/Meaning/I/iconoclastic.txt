[91m        SHORT  The word iconoclastic is an adjective referring to a breaking of established rules or destruction of accepted beliefs. It might refer to an artist with an
               unorthodox style, or an iconoclastic attack, either physical or verbal, on a religious doctrine or image.[0m
[36m         LONG  Consider the Greek word eik≈çn, or "image," coupled with -klastƒìs, "one who breaks," and you get a good image of someone who is iconoclastic. An iconoclastic
               approach to religion involves tearing down the icons representing the church. While this was once done physically, through riots and mayhem,
               today‚Äôs iconoclasts usually prefer using words. Not all iconoclasts are destructive, however. An iconoclastic approach to art and music has
               given rise to the development of new genres and styles through breaking the rules.[0m
