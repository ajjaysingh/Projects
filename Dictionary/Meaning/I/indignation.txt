[36m         LONG  Indignation traces back to the Latin prefix in- "not" and root dignus "worthy" and means anger at something that is unfair or unjust. Another word for
               indignation is outrage. Be careful using these words as they have a bit of a negative slant. A person who feels indignation is a little self-
               righteous and focused on not being treated the way he feels he should be.[0m
