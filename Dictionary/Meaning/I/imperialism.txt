[91m        SHORT  Imperialism is a type of government that seeks to increase its size, either by forcing (through war) or influencing (through politics) other countries to
               submit to their rule.[0m
[36m         LONG  The sun never sets on the Roman Empire, or so went the saying when Rome controlled the majority of Europe 2000 years ago. Empire has the same Latin root as
               imperialism, and the Roman Empire grew to be so vast because they invaded, conquered, and developed everywhere they could. Until Rome fell,
               that is.  Imperialism isn’t always violent, but it’s usually used in a negative sense, so watch for secret agents if you’re talking about your
               country’s policy of imperialism.[0m
