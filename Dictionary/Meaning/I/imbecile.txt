[91m        SHORT  If your best friend calls you an imbecile, he's implying that you're stupid, and he's probably pretty angry with you. An imbecile is an extremely stupid
               person.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun imbecile is used informally as an insult to mean "fool". Its origins are in the Latin word imbecille, "weak or feeble," and it was an official
               medical term for people with a specific (and low) I.Q. in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Patients who were classified as imbeciles were
               said to have no more intelligence than a seven year-old child.[0m

      Origin:  mid 16th century (as an adjective in the sense ‚Äòphysically weak‚Äô): via French from Latin imbecillus, literally ‚Äòwithout a supporting staff‚Äô, from in-
               (expressing negation) + baculum ‚Äòstick, staff‚Äô. The current sense dates from the early 19th century.
