  SHORT        If your school begins building a swimming pool on land that does not belong to it, the city might issue an injunction to stop it. An injunction is an official
               order issued by a judge.
  LONG         In general injunctions are court ordered settlements or commands. In the United States, judges cannot create laws, but they can require someone to do
               something or to stop doing something. If you were wrongly fired from a job, a court may issue an injunction to your former employer, requiring
               him or her to hire you back or pay your back salary.
