[91m        SHORT  Can't manage your stubborn little brother who won't do what anyone says? You could call him intractable, or you could call your mother. Problems are
               intractable when they can't be solved.[0m
[36m         LONG  Intractable means not tractable. Helpful, right? No? Let's break it down. In both words you see the word tract. A contract is a written document that explains
               how a legal situation is to be managed together. When someone is tractable they are able to be managed or handled. When they are intractable,
               they are as unmanageable as a hungry two-year old.[0m
