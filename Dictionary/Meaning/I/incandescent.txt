[91m        SHORT  When heated, coals become incandescent, which means that they glow red-hot. You could also describe a brilliant and moving novel as incandescent.[0m
[36m         LONG  Incandescent, like the word candle, has its origins in the Latin word candere meaning "to glow or shine." Combined with the suffix in meaning "within," its
               meaning can be easily pulled from the combination of its root words: "to glow or shine from within." Fire crackers are incandescent because
               they give off brilliant lights when heated, but look up at a blazing fireworks display, and you'll find it's quite moving, or incandescent with
               intensity and brilliance.[0m
