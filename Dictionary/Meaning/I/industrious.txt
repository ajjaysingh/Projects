[36m         LONG  The word industrious is closely related to the word industry, used for both the quality of being hardworking, ‚ÄúHe is a model of industry,‚Äù as well as a field
               of business, "the construction industry." It might help to remember the Industrial Revolution, the time when machinery was introduced to the
               manufacturing world. If you're industrious, you work as hard as machines do![0m
