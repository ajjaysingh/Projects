[91m        SHORT  Incongruity means out of place — something that doesn't fit in its location or situation. The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle at the incongruity of

               incongruity, as would a pacifist at a meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that something is incongruous, or
               inappropriate. A purple towel is an incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.[0m
