[91m        SHORT  To be imprudent means lacking self-restraint when it would be wise to have it, like that time you started dancing on the table during a math test. Remember
               that? Everybody else does.[0m
[36m         LONG  Prudent means "wise or shrewd," but add the prefix im- meaning "not," suddenly you have an adjective that describes the opposite of being wise or shrewd. An
               imprudent person doesn't think about the consequences and might cross the street without looking both ways or bring the radio into the bath for
               a little light listening. Careless, wild, imprudent behavior can get you into big trouble![0m
