[91m        SHORT  If you're robbed, much of what is stolen can be replaced. All you need is the cash value of what was lost. But some things‚Äì‚Äìfamily photos, heirloom
               jewelry‚Äì‚Äìare invaluable, meaning extremely valuable, or priceless.[0m
[36m         LONG  At first glance, you would think that invaluable means "not valuable." But to understand its meaning, you'd have to know that it was formed from the prefix
               in- "not" plus the verb value, plus the suffix ‚Äìable "able to be." So something invaluable has such great value that its value can't be
               calculated.[0m
