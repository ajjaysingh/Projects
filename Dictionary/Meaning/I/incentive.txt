[91m        SHORT  If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An incentive is something
               that stimulates you to take action or work harder.[0m
[36m         LONG  This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum, from incentivus "stimulating." In Latin, incentivus meant "setting the tune," from
               incinere "to sing." The related English verb is incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early 1980s, and has been
               criticized as business jargon.[0m
