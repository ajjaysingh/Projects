[91m        SHORT  Idealism, as "noble-mindedness," is the belief that we should always strive for our highest ideals. Sometimes, though, idealism is a sort of incurable

               see things as they really are — you don't want to go through life "wearing rose-colored glasses" — yet another definition of idealism. In
               philosophy, idealism is the theory that ideas are the only reality.[0m
