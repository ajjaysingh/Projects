[91m        SHORT  The verb irk means "annoy," so if the incessant barking of your next door neighbor's pug is driving you crazy, you can say that the noise irks you.[0m
[36m         LONG  Being irked is an individual thing ‚Äî what drives you crazy might be something your friend doesn't even notice. For example, it might irk your grammarian
               friend every time he hears someone says "ain't," but other people don't mind it. The earliest version of the word irk, irken, meant "to feel
               weary or tired," but it later came to mean "to tire of or to be disgusted with."[0m
