[91m        SHORT  Incipient means something is in an early stage of existence. In its incipient form, basketball was played with a soccer ball and peach baskets for goals.

[36m         LONG  Incipient comes from the Latin incipere "to begin." The related, and more commonly used, word inception means the beginning or the start. It is important to
               note that when something is in an incipient stage, there is a chance it will never come to completion. So be on the lookout for incipient
               trouble or an incipient crisis — you might be able to prevent it from happening.[0m

               ‘take’.
