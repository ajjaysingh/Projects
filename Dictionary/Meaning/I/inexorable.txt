[91m        SHORT  When a person is inexorable, they're stubborn. When a thing or process is inexorable, it can't be stopped.[0m
[36m         LONG  This is a word for people and things that will not change direction. An inexorable person is hard-headed and cannot be convinced to change their mind, no
               matter what. You can also say that a process, like the progress of a deadly illness, is inexorable because it can't be stopped. A speeding
               train with no brakes is inexorable; it's not stopping till it crashes. When you see the word inexorable, think "No one's stopping that."[0m
