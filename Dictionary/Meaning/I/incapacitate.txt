[91m        SHORT  If you are incapacitated, you can‚Äôt do what you normally do, what you‚Äôre being asked to do ‚Äî or perhaps, much of anything. To incapacitate someone is to cause
               him or her to be unable to function normally, like a bad cold that incapacitates you.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb incapacitate is related to the word capacity. Capacity comes from the Latin word capacitas, meaning ‚Äúthat can contain,‚Äù or how much something ‚Äî
               brain, bucket or otherwise ‚Äî can hold. The prefix in- reverses the meaning and when the suffix -ate is added, incapacitate means someone has
               been made unable to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù much ‚Äî like attention, effort, or energy.[0m
