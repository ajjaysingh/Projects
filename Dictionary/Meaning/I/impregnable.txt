[91m        SHORT  When something is impregnable it is not easily taken by force and can stand up to any attack. We usually use it in reference to some form of protection, like
               a fort or a solid defensive line in football.[0m
[36m         LONG  The genealogy of the adjective impregnable includes the Middle French word prenable, meaning "vulnerable, easily conquered," which itself came from the verb
               prendre, which meant "to take." The addition of the negative prefix im- flipped the meaning. Impregnable can be used to describe anything that
               cannot be entered or successfully attacked. Seventeenth-century theater critic Jeremy Collier once said, "True courage is a result of
               reasoning. A brave mind is always impregnable."[0m
