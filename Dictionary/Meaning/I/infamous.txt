[91m        SHORT  Someone who is infamous has a very bad reputation. If you become a Hollywood star and find yourself on the pages of gossip magazines for your affairs and
               addictions, you will have succeeded in becoming infamous.[0m
[36m         LONG  Infamous is from Latin infamis, for negative fame. If you're bad but unknown, then you're not infamous ‚Äî it's reserved for those wicked and well-known people
               that capture our collective imagination.  It is a strong and resonant term. Some synonyms are notorious, disgraceful, and odious. The stress is
               on the first syllable.[0m
