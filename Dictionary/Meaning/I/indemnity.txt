[91m        SHORT  Indemnity is protection against loss or harm ‚Äî it is most often used in insurance.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you suffer an injury or there's damage to your house, an indemnity makes up for the loss ‚Äî if it's part of your insurance. An indemnity may also keep
               something or someone from being held responsible for harm. Protection indemnity is mainly offered for unlikely events. If you regularly crash
               hot-air balloons, you won‚Äôt get indemnity for the next one you rent. In fact, the balloon rental company will probably demand their own
               indemnity in case you crash again.[0m
