                                                                                   INCREDULOUS                                                                                    
  SHORT        If you are incredulous that means you can't or won't believe something. If you tell people about those aliens you met the other night, they'll probably give
               you an incredulous look.
  LONG         Incredulous is the opposite of credulous, which means "believing too easily." Both words come from the Latin word credere, which means "to believe."
               Incredulous is stronger than skeptical; if you're incredulous of something, you refuse to believe it, but if you're skeptical, you're doubtful
               but you haven't ruled it out completely.  If someone insists that your best friend is actually an underworld spy, you'll probably look at them
               with incredulous anger.
