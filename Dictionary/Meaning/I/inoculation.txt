[91m        SHORT  That nasty jab the doctor gave you as a kid was an inoculation â€” that is, a preventative measure against disease. Equally well known as a "vaccination."[0m
[36m         LONG  Inoculation is a fancy word from the Latin term Inoculationem, meaning "engrafting" or "budding." That is exactly what an inoculation is â€” the grafting of a
               milder form of some horrible disease in you that will prevent you from getting a far nastier version. Inoculation and its various forms has
               also taken on a metaphorical meaning of being protected against something, as in the American politician Alan K. Simpson's quote that "an
               educated man is thoroughly inoculated against humbug."[0m
