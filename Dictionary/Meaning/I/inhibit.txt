[91m        SHORT  When you inhibit something, you block it or hold it back. If you put plants in a dark room, you inhibit their growth. A teacher who mocks their students for
               giving wrong answers inhibits their willingness to speak up in class.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you look at the word inhibit, think hinder. Though it sounds like it might be a bad thing to inhibit something else, there is no judgment built into the
               word. A drug that inhibits the growth of cancer cells would generally be considered a very good thing. While you may wish cancer cells to be
               inhibited, you probably don't wish it upon your friend's sense of humor or your country's economic growth.[0m
