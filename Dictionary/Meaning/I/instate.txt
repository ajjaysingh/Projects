[91m        SHORT  The adverb instead means in place of or as a substitute for something else. If your best friend has a temper tantrum every time you play miniature golf, maybe
               next time you should go to the movies instead.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adverb instead was originally two words, "in stead," with "stead" coming from stede, the Old English word for place. The adverb instead can also mean
               rather than, and in this context it's usually followed by "of." Instead of worrying about the weather for your vacation, which is beyond your
               control, you should worry about whether you packed everything you need.[0m
