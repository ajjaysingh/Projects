[91m        SHORT  An indie band makes music on their own or on a very small record company, not with a large recording label. Your favorite indie group probably makes most of
               its money from touring, rather than by selling its music online.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pop musicians who record songs independently of major labels are indie, and indie filmmakers work with small budgets and unknown actors, rather than large,
               well-funded film companies. The adjective is also sometimes used simply to mean "simple," "not commercial," or "outside of the mainstream."
               Indie, a shortened form of independent, has been around since about 1920, originally referring to movies, and by 1945 it was also used for
               music labels.[0m
