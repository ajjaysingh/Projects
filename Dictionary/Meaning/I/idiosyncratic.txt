[91m        SHORT  Idiosyncratic means unique to an individual. Albert Einstein famously had lots of idiosyncratic habits.  For example, he rarely wore socks, and he talked to
               his cat.[0m
[36m         LONG  One thing that Einstein definitely wasn't was an idiot.  Yet idiosyncratic and idiot are related.  Idio is ancient Greek for "one's own." A idiosyncratic
               person is someone who does things in his own way.  And the original meaning of idiot was basically "a regular Joe" ‚Äî an ordinary person who
               keeps to himself.[0m
