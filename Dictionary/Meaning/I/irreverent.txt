[91m        SHORT  If you are irreverent, you don‚Äôt show respect toward something, like your irreverent singing of your school's alma mater in a funny voice.[0m
[36m         LONG  To be irreverent doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you don't like something; it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt display the same honor for it that other people do. You might
               have a more light-hearted approach, poking fun of the way other people seem to almost blindly show their devotion. For example, when people at
               the Louvre are standing in hushed awe in front of the "Mona Lisa" it would be irreverent to holler "What's so great about that?"[0m
