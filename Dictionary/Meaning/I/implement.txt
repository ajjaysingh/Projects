[91m        SHORT  Apply the noun implement when you want to use a fancy word for "tool." A knife and fork are implements for handling food.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun implement is a very useful word for just about anything you want to describe as a tool or a thing that helps you do something. An implement can be as
               simple as chimpanzees using a stick to eat ants with or a bulldozer that moves huge amounts of earth in building. The word relates to something
               that "fills up" a house, as in all sorts of things that allow a house to work properly.[0m
