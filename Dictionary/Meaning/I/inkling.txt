[91m        SHORT  Is someone yapping on and on and you only have the vaguest idea of what they're talking about? Then you understood just an inkling ‚Äî a glimmer, a fraction ‚Äî

[36m         LONG  Inkling can also mean a sly suggestion or faint implication. If someone drops a hint you're not wanted they've given you an inkling you're not wanted. The
               word comes from the medieval English word inclen, which suitably enough means "to utter in an undertone." In other words, what's really being
               said is in between the lines of what's actually being said on the surface. By now you've probably got the inkling that inklings can be sneaky
               things.[0m
