[91m        SHORT  You can see the word "incline" inside inclination, which clues you in to the fact that inclination has to do with leaning. Sometimes the inclination is
               literal; in most cases it's about what you incline toward in a figurative sense.[0m
[36m         LONG  An inclination is something you are leaning toward, a tendency you have. You could have a specific inclination for chocolate, or you could have an inclination
               that applies to a decision you are about to make: "Looking at this dessert menu, my inclination is to skip everything and just go home and have
               a chocolate bar."[0m
