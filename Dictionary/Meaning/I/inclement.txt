  LONG         This adjective can also refer to a person or action that is harsh and unmerciful. Inclement is from a Latin root formed from the prefix in- "not" plus clemens
               "clement." This English adjective clement can mean either mild or merciful; the more commonly used noun clemency can mean mildness or mercy.
