[36m         LONG  Itinerant is pronounced "eye-TIN-er-ant." It might remind you of itinerary, the traveler's schedule that lists flights, hotel check-in times, and other plans.
               It's no surprise that both words come from the Latin word itinerare, meaning "to travel." Itinerant was first used in the 16th century to
               describe circuit judges who traveled to faraway courtrooms. Today, almost anyone can be an itinerant.[0m
