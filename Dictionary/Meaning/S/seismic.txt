[91m        SHORT  For the ancient Greeks, "seismos" meant an earthquake. Later on, when the study of earthquakes became a science, anything seismic meant anything related to
               the study of the pressures in the Earth's crust.[0m
[36m         LONG  The English language has a long and proud tradition of stealing scientific words and applying them in all sorts of ways that scientists probably wish they
               didn't: Darwinian, tempestuous, evolutionary ‚Äî to name but three. It's the same with seismic, which is now far more likely to be applied to
               political or psychological turmoil than anything to do with the earth opening up and molten hot lava spewing out.[0m
