[91m        SHORT  You might want to call someone subversive if they are sneakily trying to undermine something, from the social structure of your high school to an entire
               system of government.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use subversive as a noun or an adjective without changing it one whit. Note the prefix sub meaning "underneath" with the remainder coming from the
               Latin vertere "to turn." Think about a subversive as a sneaky kind of revolutionary who tries to turn the system from underneath. Art or
               literature is considered subversive if it attempts to undermine the morals and traditions of a society.[0m
