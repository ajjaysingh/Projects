[91m        SHORT  Sabotage isn't very nice: It's when you ruin or disrupt something by messing up a part of it on purpose. Loosening the blades on your competitor's ice skates
               would definitely be considered sabotage.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sabotage comes from the French word saboter, which literally means ‚Äúwalk noisily.‚Äù That's funny, because the last thing you'd want to do when committing an
               act of sabotage is stomp around and get caught. It‚Äôs believed that sabotage came into use in 1910 as a noun, and then later in 1918 as a verb.
               Apparently, people only became so cruel in the last century or so.[0m
