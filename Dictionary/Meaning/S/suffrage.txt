                                                                                     SUFFRAGE                                                                                     
  SHORT        Suffrage is the right to vote in public elections. Universal suffrage means everyone gets to vote, as opposed to only men, or property holders. Suffrage has
               nothing to do with "suffering," unless the wrong person is elected.
  LONG         Female supporters of women's suffrage in 1906 were called suffragettes, because the French suffix –ette was trendy back then. But nowadays words with -ette
               are shunned because they imply the inferiority of women. So it seems that female supporters of a woman's right to vote were referred to by a
               sexist term.

     >         Women not only varied in their support of women’s suffrage, they have also varied in their support of female candidates.
     >         Only Tennessee had a man named Harry Burn, who cast the deciding vote on suffrage.
     >         The Civil Rights Act, women’s suffrage, labor rights, the anti-war movement, the very founding of our republic: All of these had their roots in protest.
