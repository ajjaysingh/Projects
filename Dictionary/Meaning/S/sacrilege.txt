                                                                                    SACRILEGE                                                                                     
  SHORT        If you show up to an animal rights rally with a bucket full of fried chicken for lunch, you may be accused of committing sacrilege. You are violating a belief
               held sacred, at least by some individuals.
  LONG         Sacrilege has its roots in the Latin sacr-, meaning "holy." Sacrilege was originally reserved for talking about blasphemous acts that disrespect, violate, or
               misuse holy traditions or objects. However, today the term sacrilege carries a broader, and lighter, meaning than its origins suggest. For
               example, it's usually considered sacrilege to root for the out-of-town team that's playing against your home team. Ancient users of this word
               might think our looser definition is sacrilege.

     >         "That's beyond sacrilege. It's the beating heart of New York City."
     >         I know it’s sacrilege to some hockey fans, but enough is enough.
     >         And those feelings can basically be summed up as: “Sacrilege”!
     >         The idea of shipping sand, better beach-volleyball sand, to one of the world’s most iconic beaches was sacrilege.
     >         As such I have vowed never to return home and be part of that sacrilege.
