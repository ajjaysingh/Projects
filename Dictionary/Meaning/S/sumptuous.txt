[91m        SHORT  Sumptuous could be used to describe a room appointed with the finest furniture, a lush orchestra playing a beautiful symphony, or a meal meant for a king.
               Sumptuous describes something that costs a lot and imparts sensory pleasure.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sumptuous comes from the Latin sumptus which means expensive. Sumptus is related to sumere which means to consume. The word sumptuous carries both meanings
               with it. It is a pricey, high quality thing that's meant to be consumed or enjoyed. You wouldn't use sumptuous to describe a tractor, even if
               has leather seats and cost more than your house.[0m
