[36m         LONG  Every once in a while, the word sire is used for a human ‚Äî your dad is your sire ‚Äî but it's much more common to find this word describing an animal's male
               parent. It's also a verb, meaning "to father," as in "My prize pig sires the cutest piglets." In the old days, you'd also use sire to directly
               address a nobleman or a king. It comes from the Latin word senior, "elder."[0m
