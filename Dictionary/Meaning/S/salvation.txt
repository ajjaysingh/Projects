[91m        SHORT  Salvation is the act of saving from sin or evil, or sometimes just from an unpleasant situation.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word salvation comes from the Latin salvare, "to save." Each of the monotheistic religions has a different idea about the way to achieve salvation.
               Salvation doesn't always have to do with theology; if a freak snowstorm on your camping trip has you worried about hypothermia, salvation can
