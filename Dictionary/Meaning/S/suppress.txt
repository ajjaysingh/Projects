[91m        SHORT  To suppress something means to curb, inhibit, or even stop it. If the sound of your boss moving in his chair sounds like gas, you‚Äôre going to have to learn
               how to suppress your giggles.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the strictest sense, suppress means to put an end to something by force, like a government that suppresses the right to free speech by shutting down the
               newspapers or the military suppressing an uprising by rebel forces. But we also use suppress in less serious terms to describe an attempt to
               muffle or stifle something, such as suppressing a sneeze in a quiet theater or suppressing your true emotions to not cause a teary scene.[0m
