[91m        SHORT  If you really want to win someone's heart, take your ukulele to his house at night and serenade him under his open window. When you serenade someone, you play
               or sing a song, often outdoors.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Italian, serenata means "an evening song," and the noun serenade is a tune played or sung, either for one specific person or for a larger audience,
               outside. It's still a serenade if you sing in the daytime, but the classic example of a serenade is a man singing below a woman's window at
               night. The word serenade can be both a noun ‚Äî the song itself ‚Äî and a verb ‚Äî the act of singing or playing the song.[0m
