[91m        SHORT  Most people think of ice cream when they think of the noun scoop, but journalists who get a story before others also get a scoop, and dog owners need to scoop
               up after their dogs or else they will get a ticket for littering.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a newspaper reporter gets a scoop, it means they beat every other reporter to publish an important story. Other meanings of scoop come from the shape and
               motion of a scoop, which is hollowed out and looks kind of like a pocket. Also, if you pick up a little dog into your arms, you might say you
               scooped it up. Scoop is one of many words that can be a noun and a verb, even in the same sentence: when you go to an ice cream shop you can
               ask your server to give you one, two, or three scoops.[0m
