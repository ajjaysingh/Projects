[36m         LONG  Stroke is a high value word ‚Äî many meanings, yet rarely misunderstood in context.  You can swim a certain stroke (or just doggie paddle), you can stroke a
               cat's fur, you can figuratively stroke your boss's ego by flattering him, or you can have a stroke of brilliance and solve world hunger.
               Hopefully you won't suffer a stroke and need hospitalization. Its origin as a medical term goes back to the 1500s when it was shortened from
               "the Stroke of God's Hand."[0m
