[91m        SHORT  A scrap is a little leftover bit of something. You might jot down notes on a scrap of paper, or you might toss a scrap of food to your happy dog.[0m
[36m         LONG  A scrap is typically a small item that originally was part of something larger, like a scrap of fabric that was once part of a larger piece. Scrap can also
               describe something that‚Äôs no longer useful. For example, you might take scrap metal to the recycling center. Scrap also has a verb form that
               means "discard." When you scrap your plan to move to the Bahamas, that means you‚Äôre abandoning the plan.[0m
