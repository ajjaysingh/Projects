[91m        SHORT  Skulking is cowardly. It means hiding out, either because you're trying to pull something off in secret, or you're trying to get out of doing something you're
               supposed to be doing.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you cut school, it makes sense to do it in the style of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," and enjoy yourself. Will the punishment be worse than if you skulk
               around town, avoiding teachers and people your parents know, not doing anything you really want to do? In spy movies, there are always bad guys
               in hotel lobbies, skulking about, hiding behind open newspapers.[0m
