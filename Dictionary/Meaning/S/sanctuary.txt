      Origin:  Middle English (in sense 3): from Old French sanctuaire, from Latin sanctuarium, from sanctus ‚Äòholy‚Äô. Early use in reference to a church or other sacred place
               where a fugitive was immune, by the law of the medieval Church, from arrest, gave rise to sense 1, sense 2.
