[91m        SHORT  Solitude is the state of being alone. You might crave solitude after spending the holidays with your big, loud family ‚Äî you want nothing more than to get away
               from everyone for a little while.[0m
[36m         LONG  Solitude can also refer to a place where you're completely alone. The middle of the woods, the top of a big mountain, the middle of a vast desert, even your
               room ‚Äî these are places where you might go for solitude. Solitude comes from the Latin word solitudinem, which means "loneliness," but if you
               have moments of solitude that doesn't necessarily mean you're lonely. The word solitude carries the sense that you're enjoying being alone by
               choice.[0m
