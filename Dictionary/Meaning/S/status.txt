[91m        SHORT  If someone wants to know the status of something, they want to know what condition it's in, where it is, or how much progress it's made. You've probably
               checked the status of your flight to see if it's on time or delayed.[0m
[36m         LONG  Status doesn't only apply to the state of flights, projects, and traffic jams ‚Äî it also can be used to refer to a person's social standing or rank. In fact,
               status was first used in reference to someone's height, and later, their legal standing. Someone with VIP status gets to fly first class and
               probably has a bunch of photographers following them.[0m
