[91m        SHORT  The annoying trait of acting morally superior to others is called sanctimony. Your brother's sanctimony about being quiet after nine o'clock might make you
               want to have a loud dance party at midnight.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you find yourself giving an insincere, smug lecture to your friends about the way they should behave or the things they ought to do, you're guilty of
               sanctimony. Before this word (and its partner, sanctimonious) gained its modern meaning, it was used un-ironically, to mean "virtuousness." It
               comes from the Latin sanctimonia, "holiness," from the root sanctus, "holy."[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Sanctimonious  is a twist on the words sanctity and sacred, which mean holy or religious. A  sanctimonious  person might think he's holy, but their attitude
               comes across more like "holier-than-thou."
