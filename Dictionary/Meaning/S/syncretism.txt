[91m        SHORT  Syncretism is a union or attempted fusion of different religions, cultures, or philosophies ‚Äî like Halloween, which has both Christian and pagan roots, or the
               combination of Aristotelian philosophy with the belief system of the early punk rock practitioners.[0m
[36m         LONG  Syncretism may apply to something whose parts sync well, like salsa dance (a merging combination of African, Latin American, and European cultures), or
               something whose parts merge less successfully. Syncretism is also a word used for merging different inflection word forms, so that a word can
               serve more than one function. Examples in English are you, which can be an object or a subject, or pet, which is the same in the past and
               present tense.[0m
