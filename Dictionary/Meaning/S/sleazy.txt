[91m        SHORT  Something that is sleazy is low and nasty. It‚Äôs a perfect word to describe characters like the sleazy door-to-door con men who cheat old ladies into selling
               them their jewelry at a deep discount.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sleazy originally meant flimsy, but nowadays it‚Äôs only used to describe morally degraded people or places. Usually it refers to sexual behavior, but it is
               often associated with people trying to swindle others as well. It‚Äôs not as bad as perverse or criminal, which suggest that a line has been
               crossed. But sleazy people make you feel uncomfortable, for sure.[0m
