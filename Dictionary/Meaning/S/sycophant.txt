[36m         LONG  Sycophant is from Latin sycophanta, from Greek sykophantēs, from sykon "fig" and phainein "to show, make known." The original sense was that of an informer, a
               person who gives information about criminal activities. "Showing the fig" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers.
               The gesture was used to taunt an opponent or to make an accusation against someone.[0m
