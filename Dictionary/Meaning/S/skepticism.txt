[91m        SHORT  Skepticism is doubt about something ‚Äî you're just not convinced or can't totally believe it. If your brother is only four feet tall, you should view his
               claims that he can slam dunk a basketball with a lot of skepticism.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you like to poke holes in other people's ideas, then you are full of skepticism. Some people follow a specific belief system that questions the truth of
               anything, but most people save their skepticism for certain things. Tabloids, Big Foot sightings, and over-eager used car salesmen should all
               be viewed with a little skepticism. On the other hand, gullible folks believe everything they hear and don't have much, if any, skepticism.[0m
