[36m         LONG  It used to be that corpses were dressed for burial not in person‚Äôs best outfit but in a shroud ‚Äî a garment, often white, made to cover the body. When ghosts,
               zombies or mummies are depicted in rags, they are wearing the remains of their burial shrouds. If you should hide from them by covering
               yourself with an abandoned tarp, you will be shrouding yourself from sight.[0m
