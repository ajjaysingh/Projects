[91m        SHORT  A snippet is a tiny piece. You might only have time to read a snippet of "Moby Dick" before your early English class ‚Äî just enough to know it's a book about a

               less physical bits. You may get a snippet of information by watching TV news with the sound turned off, or end your writing workshop with just
               a snippet of an idea for your screenplay. It comes from snip, with its Low German root snippen, "to snip or shred."[0m
