[91m        SHORT  While the word stallion most often means "male horse," you can also call donkeys and zebras (as well as other horse relatives) stallions.[0m
[36m         LONG  A horse is frequently referred to as a stallion once he fathers a foal. While in most of the western world stallions are primarily kept for breeding, it is
               popular in parts of the Middle East and Asia for stallions to be used for riding (almost always by men). The word stallion comes from stall,
               referencing ancient laws requiring male breeding horses to be kept in stalls rather than allowed to wander in fields.[0m
