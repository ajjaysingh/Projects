[91m        SHORT  Something false or inauthentic is spurious. Don't trust spurious ideas and stories. Spurious statements often are lies, just as a spurious coin is a

[36m         LONG  Anytime you see the word spurious, you're dealing with things that can't be trusted or accepted at face value. A spurious claim is one that's not backed up by
               the facts. A spurious argument relies on faulty reasoning ‚Äî and maybe some lies. Politicians often accuse each other of saying things that are
               spurious and meant to deceive the voters. As long as you're honest, clear, and not trying to trick anyone, nobody can say you're being
               spurious.[0m
