[91m        SHORT  There is a tone to the word stagnant that sounds like what it is: lacking movement, stale, and inactive, especially with exaggerated pronunciation,
               "staaaagnant."[0m
[36m         LONG  Stagnant came into use in the 17th century as a description for water or air that wasn't moving or circulating, like in a scum-covered pond or a closed-off
               room. Often things that are stagnant also have a smell from sitting too long in one place. Not that this happens to everyone, but sitting in
               front of a TV playing video games without moving more than the fingers can make a person stagnant, sometimes with an accompanying odor.[0m
