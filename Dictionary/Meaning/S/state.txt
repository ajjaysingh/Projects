[36m         LONG  State comes from the Latin status, meaning "condition of a country." Interestingly, even before the Revolutionary War, Britain called the American colonies
               states. The ‚ÄúStates‚Äù still refers to America, but state can refer to any country‚Äôs civil government. The idea of state as a physical or
               emotional condition came later. Depending on your state of mind, you can state that the state of your state is awesome. Unless it‚Äôs in a state
               of emergency, which is no good.[0m
