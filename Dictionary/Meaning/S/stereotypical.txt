[91m        SHORT  Stereotypical describes an action or a characterization that is oversimplified, widely imitated, or handed down by tradition.[0m
[36m         LONG  As in Aesop’s Fables, stereotypical characters behave predictably, or according to type, which, in Greek, literally means to strike in a mold or an
               impression.  But most interesting people and stories do not easily fit into molds, and typecasts can be socially offensive.  It might be
               stereotypical in a comedy skit to see police officers eating donuts, but when you get pulled over for missing a stop sign it’s best to keep
               that idea to yourself![0m
