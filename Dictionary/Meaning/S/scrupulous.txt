[36m         LONG  A scrupulous person is full of scruples, which are concerns about doing things that are morally right. Such a person is hesitant or doubtful, and might have
               trouble deciding what is morally right or wrong. The adjective scrupulous is from Latin scr≈´pul≈çsus, from scr≈´pulus "scruple." A near synonym
               is punctilious.[0m
