[91m        SHORT  To snitch is to tattle on someone, and a snitch is someone who tattles. If you snitch on your brother when he "borrows" five dollars without asking, he might
               call you a snitch — but, on the bright side, he'll probably have to pay you back.[0m
[36m         LONG  The oldest meaning of the informal snitch is "to betray" or, as a noun, "informer." This probably stems from 18th-century underworld slang, in which  snitch
               meant "nose" — perhaps because a snitch is really nosy. A newer definition of snitch, "to steal," is thought to be a variation on snatch, and
               it first appeared around the turn of the 20th century. In the Harry Potter books, a snitch is a winged, golden ball used in the game of
               Quidditch.[0m
