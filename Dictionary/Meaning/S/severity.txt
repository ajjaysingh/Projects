[91m        SHORT  Severity is a plain, no-frills hardness––or the degree of hardness. You might talk about the severity of the northern winter, or the severity of your
               grandfather's discipline.[0m
[36m         LONG  Severity, with its root in severe, has several nuances. It can mean a hardship, like war’s severity. It also refers to an extreme plainness. Think of the
               severity of Amish life: no phones, cars, or other modern technology. And you might use it to describe your math teacher’s manner: his severity
               is indicated by his short, clipped sentences, angry stare, and propensity to fail students without mercy.[0m
