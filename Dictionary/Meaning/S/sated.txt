[91m        SHORT  Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course meal. Other times it takes just a small salad to sate your appetite, or to satisfy your
               hunger.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, “to satiate,” and can be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If
               you have been craving something sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never get enough
               jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as insatiable, a word used to describe a person or entity whose appetites — literally
               or figuratively — are impossible to satisfy.[0m
