                                                                                      SATED                                                                                       
  SHORT        Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course meal. Other times it takes just a small salad to sate your appetite, or to satisfy your
               hunger.
  LONG         The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, “to satiate,” and can be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If
               you have been craving something sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never get enough
               jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as insatiable, a word used to describe a person or entity whose appetites — literally
               or figuratively — are impossible to satisfy.

     >         The patties vanish before I know what happened, and I am happily sated.
     >         Seven appearances in the National Invitation Tournament have hardly sated a Wildcats fan base annually accustomed to scheduling other plans on Selection
               Sunday.
     >         None in my party are linebackers, but all of us end the meal less than sated.
     >         “Now that we have all those dimensions sated, it’s basically the challenge of designing a TV set all over again,” he added.
     >         When Meltzer finished Sunday, he walked down the mountain, sat in a chair and sated himself with pepperoni pizza and a beer.
