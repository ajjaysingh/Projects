[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective stubborn to describe someone who is not open to new ideas or ways of doing things, like your uncle who refuses to listen to any music made
               after 1990. Stubborn is the opposite of flexible.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Middle English version of stubborn carried the sense of ‚Äúuntamable, implacable,‚Äù and there‚Äôs still a hint of that in how it is used today. A stubborn
               person holds on to a view or an attitude, refusing to change ‚Äî to the point of being unreasonable. Things can also be stubborn, like a stain
               that no amount of scrubbing can clean or a medical condition that, even with treatment, doesn't improve.[0m
