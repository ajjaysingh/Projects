  LONG         Following your impulses and giving in to them — rather than resisting or limiting them — is one way to go on a spree. It can be a dancing spree, in which you
               dance all night long, or a shopping spree, in which you max out your credit card at the mall. The original slang meaning, and one that's still
               used today, is "a drinking bout," and it may be rooted in the French word esprit, "lively wit."
