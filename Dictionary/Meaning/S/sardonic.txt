[91m        SHORT  If someone is being scornful and mocking in a humorous way, call her sardonic. If you want to write comic sketches for late-night talk shows, work on being

[36m         LONG  Sardonic comes from the Greek adjective Sardonios, which actually describes a plant from a place called Sardinia that supposedly made your face contort into a
               horrible grin...right before you died from its poison.  The Greeks used sardonic for laughter, but we only use it when someone's humor is also
               mocking or ironic.[0m
