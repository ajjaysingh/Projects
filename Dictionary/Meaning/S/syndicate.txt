               is an early example of a syndicate. Syndicate can also describe an agency that sells the rights to copyrighted material, such as feature
               articles, to newspapers or magazines. The word has a verb form as well. If you work for a syndicate, you might syndicate the classic "Peanuts"
               cartoon strip in hundreds of newspapers around the world.[0m
