  SHORT        You write the lyrics and your friend composes the music. Separately each of you is pretty good, but together you’ve got a mega-hit song. That’s synergy —
               working together to create something greater than either of you could do alone.
  LONG         The word synergy comes from the Greek sun “together” and ergon “work” (the same root that gives us ergonomic and energy).  When one thing magnifies the effect
               of another, together they have synergy. If your company makes some revolutionary kind of yo-yo, you may decide to acquire a company that
               distributes toys, as you’d expect there would be a natural synergy: each company will benefit from the other’s strengths, and together they’ll
               be stronger than either would be by itself.

     >         The synergy between the solo quartet and the orchestra was breathtaking.
     >         Car companies see great synergy in their development of electric cars, hoping to carve a niche for themselves in a completely different industry.
     >         “In the end we will forfeit synergies, people’s incomes will fall and national vigor will decline,” Mr. Liang wrote.
     >         “This deal is about synergy and growth. It’s all about partnerships, and those choices decide the winners and losers.”
     >         Per Synergy’s tracking stats, during their only year at Kentucky, Wall made eight passes in transition to Cousins, and Cousins scored on all eight.
