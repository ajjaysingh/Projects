[91m        SHORT  Stubby things are thick and short, like your sister's stubby little toes or the stubby remains of your favorite pencil that's been sharpened until it's barely

[36m         LONG  For some reason, this adjective is most commonly used to describe people's fingers and toes: "I always wanted to be a concert pianist like my brother, but my
               fingers were just too stubby." But you can use it for anything short and blunt, like the stubby baby carrots your mom packs in your lunch or
               the stubby, useless arms of an upright dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex.[0m
