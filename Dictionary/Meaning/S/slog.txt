[91m        SHORT  When you slog, you toil at something, working hard and often slowly to get a difficult job done. You might slog with your shovel through the pile of snow in
               your driveway.[0m
[36m         LONG  A worker might slog through a pile of papers on her desk, or slog long and hard on a construction crew. In either case, the job requires persistence and
               determination. Another way to slog is to walk with difficulty, the way someone might slog along a muddy road to the gas station after getting a
               flat tire. The original meaning of slog was "hit hard," possibly as a variation of slug.[0m
