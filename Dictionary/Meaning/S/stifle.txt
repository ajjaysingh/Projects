[91m        SHORT  To stifle is to cut off, hold back, or smother. You may stifle your cough if you don't want to interrupt a lecture or you may stifle the competition if you
               fear losing.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb stifle means ‚Äúto choke, suffocate, drown.‚Äù It can describe a claustrophobic feeling, like getting smothered by kisses from your great aunt. At its
               most extreme, stifle means to kill by cutting off respiration. The metaphoric sense of stifle didn‚Äôt develop until well after the word was
               first recorded as a verb: "I can always tell ‚Äî but never let on for fear of damaging his ego ‚Äî that my boyfriend attempts to stifle tears
               during sappy parts of movies; his eyes well up at the corners and he‚Äôll sniffle uncontrollably, claiming allergies."[0m
