[36m         LONG  Farming and war are pretty different, but they both involve silos. You may have seen a silo if you've ever visited a farm. A silo is a tall tower with a
               cylindrical (rounded) shape. The silo holds anything the farmer needs to store in bulk, especially feed for the animals. Other, non-farm silos
               hold material such as cement or coal. The military type of silo holds something more dangerous: missiles. These silos store the missiles
               underground until they‚Äôre fired.[0m
