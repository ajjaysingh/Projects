[36m         LONG  Statuesque means "like a statue," in the sense that someone is dignified, good looking, and maybe a little intimidating. It's an adjective that is almost
               always used to describe a tall woman, and while it's a compliment, it can sometimes be interpreted as meaning simply "big and tall." The Latin
               root means "statue," statua, and it in turn comes from stare, "to stand."[0m
