[91m        SHORT  When you pass a dump, you might hold your nose and say, "Oh, I can't handle the stench." A stench is a bad smell.[0m
[36m         LONG  Stench can also be used metaphorically. If it is discovered that many members of a police force have been taking money from mob bosses so that they can
               continue their life of crime, a new chief may be brought in to remove the stench of corruption from the office. In either sense, stench is the
               kind of smell that takes work to get rid of.[0m
