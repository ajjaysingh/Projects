[91m        SHORT  People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind
               the design. Or was there?[0m
[36m         LONG  In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play
               Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister ‚Äî i.e., left ‚Äî hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked,
               enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place.[0m
