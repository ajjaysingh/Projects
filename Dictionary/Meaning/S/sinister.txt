  SHORT        People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind
               the design. Or was there?
  LONG         In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play
               Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked,
               enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place.
