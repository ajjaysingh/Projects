[91m        SHORT  Anything self-indulgent you do for yourself, without thinking about other people. Enjoy a self-indulgent day at the spa! But self-indulgent can also mean
               ‚Äúselfish,‚Äù like a rambling self-indulgent  speech that puts the audience to sleep.[0m
[36m         LONG  Eating whatever you feel like, even if it's ice cream for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is self-indulgent. Spending an entire day lying in a hammock when you
               have a project to work on for school is also self-indulgent. You just do what you feel like doing: in other words, you indulge yourself.
               Indulge, "to grant as an unearned favor," comes from the Latin indulgere, "be kind, yield, or concede."[0m
