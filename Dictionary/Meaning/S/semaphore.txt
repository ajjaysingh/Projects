[91m        SHORT  A semaphore is a gadget used for conveying signals. Semaphores have either lights or mechanical arms that move.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word semaphore is related to a Greek word meaning "signal," and that's exactly the purpose of semaphores: they give signals. The place you're most likely
               to have seen a semaphore is a railroad crossing: the gadget with moving arms is a semaphore. Some semaphores have mechanical arms, while others
               just use lights to communicate. A semaphore system can also use flags. In all cases, semaphores give visual signals that communicate something
               important, especially to people traveling.[0m
