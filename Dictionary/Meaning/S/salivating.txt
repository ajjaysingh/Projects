[91m        SHORT  To salivate is to drool, or to produce saliva. People also figuratively salivate over things they desire.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are two related types of salivating. The first is simple: when you salivate, you produce saliva in your mouth. People salivate when they smell something
               delicious cooking or are hungry. You can also describe someone as salivating — metaphorically — over an attractive woman, a handsome man, an
               expensive car, a high-paying job, or anything else that's desirable. You can also say that people drool over these things they want, although
               they’re not literally drooling.[0m
