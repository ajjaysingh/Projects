                                                                                      SOLEMN                                                                                      
  SHORT        If you’ve ever attended a funeral, you were probably struck by how quiet, earnest, and solemn the mood was.  You can use the word solemn to describe anything
               that's really serious and dignified.
  LONG         The adjective solemn comes from the Latin sollemnis, which means formal or ceremonial. You can still use it to describe a ceremony or event, but it's also a
               good word for talking about someone who's serious and sincere and maybe lacks a sense of humor about certain things.  Here's a trick for
               remembering it: Think of a "sole man," a serious guy standing alone at a party talking to no one.

     >         Authorities called on islanders to go there to make a “solemn oath of fulfillment with the concept of the revolution.”
     >         Cuba became a party-loving, colorful Caribbean island that an intellectual was trying to turn into a solemn, Party-loving Eastern European textbook.
     >         The scales that follow, so momentous and solemn, are as breathtaking as the immense central staircase of a baroque palace.
     >         Unlike Kahlo’s “dagger Venus,” she’s a solemn prisoner of her confined place in the world.
