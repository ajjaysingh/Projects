[91m        SHORT  To swish is to make something rush or hiss as it moves, or to move this way yourself. A bike might swish past you on a wet sidewalk, and you might swish your
               long dress as you continue walking.[0m
[36m         LONG  A swish is the sound that's made when a person or thing swishes â€” the swish of a dish brush on a dirty pan in the sink, or the swish of water against a dock.
               A kite swishes through the air and so does a fencing epee or a fly swatter. In basketball, you swish when you make a clean basket, without the
               ball hitting the rim or the backboard. Swish is an example of onomatopoeia â€” when a word that sounds like its meaning.[0m
