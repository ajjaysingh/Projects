[91m        SHORT  If your grandmother gives you her sapphire ring, it will probably have a translucent blue stone on it, though you may end up with a rare yellow or red

[36m         LONG  This blue gemstone is commonly known as the birthstone for those born in September. The word sapphire has been kicking around English for more than 700 years
               and enjoyed at least two dozen spellings before settling on the current, counterintuitive one. The Greek origin, sappheiros, means "blue
               stone," although it probably refers not to the sapphire but to another blue stone, the lapis lazuli.[0m
