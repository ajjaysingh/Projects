[91m        SHORT  To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them ‚Äî like when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of facing your homework.[0m
[36m         LONG  A verb is an action word, so it's ironic that the verb shirk suggests inaction in the avoidance of work. To shirk carries with it a negative connotation of
               laziness. When Eleanor Roosevelt was asked how she conquered her shyness to become a powerful public figure, she responded, "I faced each
               problem as it came along. . . . I never tried to shirk. I tried never to evade an issue. When I found I had something to do ‚Äî I just did it."
               Ah, Eleanor, why can't we all be a bit more like you?[0m
