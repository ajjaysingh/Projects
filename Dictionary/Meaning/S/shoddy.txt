  SHORT        Shoddy refers to poor materials or quality. Maybe you passed on buying a house because it leaned in an odd way and various and sundry parts were falling off.

  LONG         Shoddy originally referred to something that looked high-quality but wasnâ€™t. Later, a certain type of cloth made with leftover pieces and rags was called a
               shoddy. While shoddy often refers to materials or workmanship, questionable ethics can also be referred to as shoddy, as in the shoddy
               principles of a slumlord or the shoddy morals of someone who steals from their friends.
