[91m        SHORT  If you reject your mother's offer to buy you a pair of lederhosen with a snort and eye roll, you are spurning her generosity. To spurn means to reject with
               disdain.[0m
[36m         LONG  Originally, to spurn was to kick away. Though it's not used in that context so often anymore, being spurned still feels like a kick in the gut. You can reject
               someone kindly, or let them down easily, but you can't spurn someone with anything but malice.[0m
