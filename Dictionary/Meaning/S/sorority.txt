[91m        SHORT  If you join a sorority, you're joining a social organization for women, typically one based at a university or college. Your sorority probably has a lot of
               social events such as meetings, mixers, galas, and fundraisers.[0m
[36m         LONG  First used in the 1530s, the noun sorority stems from the Middle Latin word sororitas, meaning "sisterhood, of or pertaining to sisters." Although members of
               a sorority aren't actually biological sisters, the idea is to form a strong bond between members ‚Äî or "sisters" ‚Äî based on commitment to the
               group. To build allegiance, members of a sorority might wear the same sweatshirts with Greek letters and attend social events and regular club
               meetings.[0m
