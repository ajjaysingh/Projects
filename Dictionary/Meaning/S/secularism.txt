[91m        SHORT  Secularism is a way of life and thinking that rejects religion. So if you're into secularism, you're not into God, going to church, praying, or anything holy.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some people dig religion. Other people don't. And it's those people that live a life of secularism, far removed from anything that has to do with God or
               church. Instead of worrying about heaven or hell, secularism focuses on life as it is on Earth. People who are secularists particularly believe
               that religious ideas and beliefs should have nothing to do with government affairs or public education.[0m
