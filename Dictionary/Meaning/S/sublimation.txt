[91m        SHORT  When anything solid turns into a gas without first becoming liquid, that’s sublimation. When the surface layer of snow or ice turns into fog or steam without
               melting, this is an example of sublimation.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb sublimation is from the Latin word sublimare, meaning “raised to a higher status.” In the field of mental health, sublimation helps people who have
               urges that, if acted on, are self-destructive or dangerous to others. They are taught how to direct that energy into something productive like
               creating art, exercising, or otherwise finding an outlet to take the person's mind off the problematic thoughts.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Sublimation  is a chemical process where a solid turns into a gas without going through a liquid stage. An example of sublimiation is when ice cubes shrink in
               the freezer.
