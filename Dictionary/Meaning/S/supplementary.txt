[91m        SHORT  Supplementary is a little something extra to fill in a gap, like when your teacher suggests supplementary reading material that you may or may not get around
               to checking out.[0m
[36m         LONG  Supplementary can be an important part of something or just extra support. The word supplement comes from the Latin supplementum for "something added to fix a
               deficiency" and the suffix -ary means "connected with." Put them together and you have something connected with filling in. The supplementary
               support of digging a moat around your sand castle might save it from a wave, but that supplementary reading on your syllabus isn't required
               (although it might save your grade).[0m
