[91m        SHORT  Synthesis is the act of combining elements to form something new. If you describe your bedroom decor as a synthesis of Andy Warhol and Punk Rock, we'll know
               you mean a mixture of these two styles.[0m
[36m         LONG  Synthesis is just as comfortable in the concrete realm as it is in the abstract. Scientists use it to talk about what happens when chemicals combine ‚Äî think
               of photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize light, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food. If you call a movie "Batman meets
               Titanic," then that's synthesis as well. Political science students can remember synthesis via the famous thesis-antithesis-synthesis concept
               that suggests societies change when a widely accepted idea (a thesis) is challenged by a new, contradictory idea (an antithesis), and then
               resolved via synthesis, or a combining of the two to produce something new.[0m
