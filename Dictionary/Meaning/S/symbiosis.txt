[91m        SHORT  Symbiosis, a noun, tells about the relationship between living things that helps all of them stay alive, like the symbiosis between bees that eat nectar from
               flowers that get cross-pollinated when the bees move from one to the next.[0m
[36m         LONG  To correctly pronounce symbiosis, accent the third syllable: "sim-be-OH-sis." The prefix syn comes from the Greek word "together" and bios means "life." So
               symbiosis means "a living together." Things that live in symbiosis depend on one another, like the clown fish and anemone that protect one
               another from ocean predators, or the symbiosis between a dairy farmer and one who grows hay, trading milk for hay bales that feed the cows.[0m
