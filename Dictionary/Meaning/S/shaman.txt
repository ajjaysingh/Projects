[91m        SHORT  A shaman is a tribal healer who can act as a medium between the visible world and the spirit world.[0m
[36m         LONG  Shamans are kind of a mix between priests and doctors. Like a priest, a shaman is a holy man who represents a religion â€” in this case, shamanism. Like a
               doctor, a shaman heals people â€” or at least claims to do so. If you're not into shamanism, you can use this term more generally: A really good
               teacher, especially one who works a little mysteriously, might be said to work "like a shaman".[0m
