                                                                                     STATURE                                                                                      
  SHORT        Stature is the another way to say "height of a person," like the surprising stature of the movie star who seems so much taller in his action movies.
  LONG         Stature comes from the Latin word statura, meaning "height, size of body, growth," but today, it  also means "a high level of respect gained by achievement."
               For example, after you win a Nobel Prize, your new stature will bring new fans, more sales of your book, invitations to many exclusive dinner
               parties, and maybe even your picture on magazine covers all over the world.

     >         Fidel, more than any other political leader in recent memory, had the stature of a living myth in his own country.
     >         Every program with a similar national stature—like Michigan and Ohio State—eventually scrambled to do the same thing.
     >         When I asked Saariaho why female composers of her stature are so rare, she said, “It’s a practical question, I think. Because it’s so time-consuming.”
     >         In any other circumstance, being tapped by someone of his stature to have a voice at the highest levels of power would be hugely appealing.
     >         The problem is—and Priebus probably does understand this—the outsized stature of Infowars and Jones in the bizarre information universe where Trump resides.
