[36m         LONG  Generally meaning ‚Äúloot, booty, or plunder,‚Äù swag is the stuff in the bags of exited party-goers and plunderers alike. It can also be a bundle carried by a
               swagman, an Australian migrant worker or drifter. From the Old Norse (re: Viking) sveggja, meaning ‚Äúto swing or sway,‚Äù the verb swag can mean
