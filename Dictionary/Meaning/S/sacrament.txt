[91m        SHORT  A sacrament is a religious ceremony or rite. Sacraments are important holy events to members of that religion.[0m
[36m         LONG  Different religions recognize different sacraments. If you're a Protestant, you might attend a baptism, yet if you're Roman Catholic, you would include
               confirmation and matrimony among the various ceremonies you attend. Usually a holy person like a priest or minister needs to perform a
               sacrament. A less religious definition of this word is to think of a sacrament as something that is sacred or mysterious: a serious baseball
               fan might think of visiting Fenway Park as a sacrament.[0m
