[36m         LONG  Sanguine is from Latin sanguis "blood" and originally meant "bloody" ‚Äî in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an
               optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that "bodily humors" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no

               feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation ‚Äî or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket.[0m
