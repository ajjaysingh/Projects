[91m        SHORT  Something substantial is large in size, number, or amount: If you want to say someone spent a lot of money without being too specific, you could say they
               spent a substantial amount of money.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective substantial derives from the Latin substantia "substance," which means "stuff." A substantial meal is large enough to satisfy hunger. A
               substantial structure is strongly made or built. And a substantial man possesses wealth and property. Related to this last sense, "a man of
               substance" refers to a wealthy man with property.[0m
