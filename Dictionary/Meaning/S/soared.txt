[91m        SHORT  To soar means more than just to fly; it means to rise swiftly, to feel the wind slipping below you as you ride it higher, higher, higher. Flying is just

[36m         LONG  Think about the anticipation you feel when you buy a lottery ticket ‚Äî your hopes soar as you contemplate the possibilities. It's the same wonderful feeling
               you get when someone you have a crush on notices you, when you land that perfect job, when you hold your child. The word soar comes from the
               Latin, ex-, which means "out," and aura, meaning "breeze, air," together meaning "out of the air," which is precisely how it feels to soar.[0m
