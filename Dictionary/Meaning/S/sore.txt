[91m        SHORT  A sore is a broken patch of skin ‚Äî something you might put a bandage on ‚Äî or it's something that gives you pain, like a sore throat, that‚Äôs red and scratchy

[36m         LONG  You can have a sore and you can also be sore: if you've just ridden your bike over the Alps, you're probably pretty sore ‚Äî achy and hurting all over. Maybe
               you've heard phrases like "Don't be sore at me, boss," from old gangster movies, meaning "don't be angry." A sore point or a sore subject is
               something you don't want to discuss, like the sensitive topic of your last history quiz, the one you slept through.[0m
