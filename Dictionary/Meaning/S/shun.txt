[36m         LONG  Although the verb shun means to deliberately avoid anything, it has a specific meaning in certain groups and communities. In this case, it means to ostracize
               or expel from that group or community. The Amish, for example, may shun members of their order who repeatedly ignore the beliefs and rules of
               Amish society. The word may also be used in more casual group settings. After many attempts at being polite, you and your friends began to shun
               the obnoxious woman who never let you get a word in edgewise.[0m
