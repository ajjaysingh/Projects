[91m        SHORT  Stubble is the prickly hair that grows back after being shaved. You might find stubble on a man's chin or on a woman's leg.[0m
[36m         LONG  Stubble is a very specific kind of hair: hair that's been shaved but has grown back a little bit after a few days. On a man's face, stubble isn't quite a
               beard yet: the hair is short. Stubble feels rough, and it can be itchy. Although some men like the stubble look, most men usually go one way or
               the other: grow out a beard or shave the stubble off. You can also have stubble anywhere hair has been shaved.[0m
