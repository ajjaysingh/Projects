[91m        SHORT  Things that are subjective are open to interpretation. If you go see a movie about a jewel thief, the topic is not subjective. But whether it's a good movie
               or not is subjective.[0m
[36m         LONG  Subjective things depend on your own ideas and opinions: there isn't any universal truth. Subjective is the opposite of objective, which refers to things that
               are more clear-cut. That Earth has one moon is objective ‚Äî it's a fact. Whether the moon is pretty or not is subjective ‚Äî not everyone will
               agree. Facts are objective, but opinions are subjective. What's the best song, band, movie, or TV show? These are all very subjective issues.
               There's no right answer.[0m
