[91m        SHORT  A spark is a small, glowing particle that's either thrown off of a fire or that starts a fire. Your dad might tell everyone to stand back from the bonfire so
               they don't get burned by a spark.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sparks are burning fragments that pop up off a fire, but they're also bright flashes, like the sparks of light reflecting off your sunglasses or electrical
               sparks given off by an engine. Some small thing that promises to grow larger is yet another kind of spark ‚Äî you might notice a spark of anger
               within yourself when you see someone being treated unfairly, for example. The word spark comes from the Old English root spearca, "glowing or
               fiery particle thrown off."[0m
