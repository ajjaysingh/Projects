[91m        SHORT  If you kick your little brother in the shin and feel a strange sense of enjoyment as you watch him cry, then you’re being sadistic, meaning that you get

[36m         LONG  The Marquis de Sade was an 18th century French nobleman who became known for his unusual practices — which included finding pleasure from causing others pain.
               From the Marquis, we get the word sadism, which is used to describe someone who gets a strange enjoyment out of making others suffer. Someone
               who is sadistic might feel a cruel thrill from kicking a helpless puppy or making a child cry.[0m
