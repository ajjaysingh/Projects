[91m        SHORT  You might be enraged at the idea of doing homework on a Saturday if you consider your weekends sacrosanct — meaning they are too special or important to
               interrupt.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sacrosanct is often used to describe religious rituals and traditions, which isn’t surprising considering that this adjective comes from the Latin word for
               something that is protected by a religious sanction. A church, for example, might consider its Sunday service to be sacrosanct — a very
               important and holy ritual that cannot be changed or canceled. It’s a bad idea to criticize or change any custom or tradition that people
               consider sacrosanct — they won’t be happy about it.[0m
