[91m        SHORT  A strumpet is a woman who commits adultery or sleeps around a lot. It's an insult, although an old-fashioned one.[0m
[36m         LONG  You're more likely to read about strumpets in Shakespeare than anything written recently, because this is an out-of-style word for a woman who commits
               adultery. You can also call a strumpet an adulteress, hussy, loose woman, or trollop, but it's best to avoid all those terms since they're
               sexist and offensive.[0m
