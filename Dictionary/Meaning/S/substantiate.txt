[91m        SHORT  To substantiate is to give support to a claim. We‚Äôd really like to believe in the Tooth Fairy; however, more evidence is needed to substantiate her existence
               (besides that quarter in your pocket).[0m
[36m         LONG  Substantiate is related to the word substantial, which means "solid." So, to substantiate a claim is to make it solid or believable. If the evidence given in
               support of an argument is weak and unconvincing, that evidence can be described as insubstantial. Of course, in special cases like the Tooth
               Fairy, having substantial evidence doesn‚Äôt seem to matter; fans just keep on believing.[0m
