  SHORT        If a friend told you that her family was perfect and they never had any problems, would you believe her? If not, you may be skeptical. Skeptical people look
               at the world with a certain amount of doubt.
  LONG         This word comes from ancient Greece, where a philosopher named Pyrrho taught his followers that we can never really understand the true nature of things, only
               how they appear to us. (So basically, we should stop searching for the meaning of life and just relax.) In Pyrrho's view, the true sage was
               someone who realized that it was impossible to be certain about anything. His followers were called Skeptikoi, or Skeptics; the Greek word
               skeptikos means “given to asking questions.”
