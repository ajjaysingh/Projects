[91m        SHORT  Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say "Wow! You look splendid, darling!" Thanks the person, because splendid
               means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.[0m
[36m         LONG  Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond,
               splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning
               walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid![0m
