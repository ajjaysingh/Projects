[91m        SHORT  A sedulous person is someone who works hard and doesn't give up easily.  If you make repeated and sedulous attempts to fix a leaky pipe and it only makes
               things worse, it might be time to go online and find the number of a plumber.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are a couple of words that basically mean the same thing as sedulous but are a little more common, namely assiduous, painstaking, and diligent.  Like
               sedulous, all of these adjectives can be turned into adverbs by adding the suffix ly: "He assiduously tried to fix the pipe, but to no avail."[0m
