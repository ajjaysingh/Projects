[91m        SHORT  To smother is to overwhelm or suffocate. If you've ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend who calls you twenty five times an hour to check up on you, then you
               know what it means to be smothered by someone.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word smother literally means to deprive of oxygen, so it can be used to refer to someone who gets suffocated by a pillow. In everyday conversation, the
               word is often used to refer to the act of making someone feel like they‚Äôre being deprived of oxygen or personal space. If you have a mother who
               likes to smother you by asking where you're going every time you see her, then it's likely you‚Äôre already dreaming of moving out![0m
