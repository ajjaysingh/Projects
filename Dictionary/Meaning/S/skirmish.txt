[91m        SHORT  A skirmish is a small fight ‚Äî more a dust-up than a full-out battle ‚Äî and it can refer to a physical fight or just a battle of words. It is definitely
               confrontational, though.[0m
[36m         LONG  Think of a skirmish as kind of a mini-battle, although a military skirmish can end with casualties. Still, although such an encounter can be serious, even the
               very word skirmish sounds slight, like a stirring of dust in the breeze.  Shakespeare referred to the combative nature of his characters
               Beatrice and Benedick, in "Much Ado About Nothing," as "a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but there's a
               skirmish of wit between them."[0m
