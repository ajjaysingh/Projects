[36m         LONG  Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin for "sit on top," and it often means to replace with
               something better. A version 10 of a computer game will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced
               too, as in "the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older." To supersede is generally a good thing, but being
               superseded is not always that great for the replaced person.[0m

      Origin:  late 15th century (in the sense ‘postpone, defer’): from Old French superseder, from Latin supersedere ‘be superior to’, from super- ‘above’ + sedere ‘sit’.
               The current sense dates from the mid 17th century.
