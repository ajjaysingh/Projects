[36m         LONG  Serendipity does not come from Latin or Greek, but rather was created by a British nobleman in the mid 1700s from an ancient Persian fairy tale. The meaning
               of the word, good luck in finding valuable things unintentionally, refers to the fairy tale characters who were always making discoveries
               through chance. You can thank serendipity if you find a pencil at an empty desk just at you walk into an exam and realize that you forgot
               yours.[0m
