[91m        SHORT  Someone who acts as a surrogate takes the place of another person. If a celebrity leaves her seat to use the restroom in the middle of a big Hollywood awards
               ceremony, a surrogate will take his or her place until she returns.[0m
[36m         LONG  Surrogate comes from the Latin word surrogare, which means "to put in another's place," or "to substitute." An uncle might refer to his niece as a surrogate
               child if they are very close, especially if he doesn't have his own biological children. Since 1978, surrogate has also been used to describe a
               woman who carries and delivers a baby for another person or couple.[0m
