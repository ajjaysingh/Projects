[36m         LONG  Coming from the Latin stipendium, which means ‚Äútax, pay, or gift,‚Äù the noun stipend is defined as a regular, unchanging payment usually given as reward for
               services, but sometimes given as an allowance with no services or expectations attached. A summer internship that does not offer a full salary
