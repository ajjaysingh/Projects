[91m        SHORT  The sanctimonious person sounds like a hypocrite when he preaches to a friend about the evils of drugs, while he drinks one beer after another.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sanctimonious is a twist on the words sanctity and sacred, which mean holy or religious. A sanctimonious person might think he's holy, but their attitude
               comes across more like "holier-than-thou." Though sanctimonious people might try to act like saints, their actions are far from pure or holy,
               which just makes them sound like hypocrites.[0m
