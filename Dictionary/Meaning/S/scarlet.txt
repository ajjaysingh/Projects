[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective scarlet to describe things that are a deep, rich red color, like a robin's breast or a wild strawberry.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some things are such a vivid shade that red doesn't seem to be quite accurate ‚Äî scarlet is the perfect word to use for them. Blood is scarlet, and so are
               rubies and ripe cherries and some brilliant red roses. You can also use scarlet as a noun, to talk about the color itself: "My favorite painter
               uses a lot of scarlet." In the mid-13th century, scarlet simply meant "rich cloth," which might have been the color scarlet or some other color
               entirely.[0m
