[36m         LONG  Spinster originally meant "a spinner of thread," and as that was a job typically done by unmarried women, it came to have the meaning ‚Äî even in legal
               documents ‚Äî of "single woman." Another term for spinster is the equally old-fashioned sounding old maid. Either way, it means a woman who never
               got married. Spinster is not a word you should call anyone: it reduces single women to one detail about their lives.[0m
