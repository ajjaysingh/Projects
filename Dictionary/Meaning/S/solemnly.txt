[91m        SHORT  To do something solemnly is to do it in a grave and earnest manner. While you might wear black to both a funeral and an art opening, it‚Äôs appropriate to
               behave more solemnly at the funeral.[0m
[36m         LONG  Solemnly carries a sense of seriousness and dignity. If you're a witness in court, you'll be asked, "Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
               and nothing but the truth?" This would not be the time to bust out your clown nose. There are other scenarios where it‚Äôs appropriate to behave
               solemnly, like at a religious ceremony or at the bedside of an ill relative, but try not to act that way at a kid's birthday party.[0m
