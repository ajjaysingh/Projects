[91m        SHORT  Oh, snap! When something snaps, it breaks or separates suddenly, often with a cracking sound. A snap can also be a fastener on clothes. And if you like a
               song, you can snap your fingers to the beat or snap a selfie of yourself dancing.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb snap is useful for many things that make a similar sharp sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or snap a whip. An animal's
               quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun, it can mean "fastener" or "the sound of a snap." A snap judgment is a decision you make almost
               instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short period of bitter weather.[0m
