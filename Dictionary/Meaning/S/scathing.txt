[91m        SHORT  Scathing means witheringly harsh. If you enter a singing contest and the judge says that your singing is like that of a toad with laryngitis, that is scathing

[36m         LONG  Scathing comes from an old Norse verb, to scathe, which means to injure by fire or lighting. Now we use it when someone‚Äôs critique is so harsh that it feels
               like you've been burned. If your best friend turns against you and advertises your faults to the world, and you feel like everyone is staring
               and talking about you, you are having a scathing experience.[0m
