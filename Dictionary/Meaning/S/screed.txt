[91m        SHORT  A screed is a long, boring speech or piece of writing with a bad attitude, like a rant. If you‚Äôve had enough and you‚Äôre not going to take it anymore, go ahead
               and write an angry screed.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can also call a screed a "harangue" or a "tirade." Another totally separate meaning of the word is ‚Äúa construction tool made of wood or plaster that acts
               as a guide for the thickness of new plaster.‚Äù Screed originally meant "strip of cloth," like the kind you might write a long list on in the old
               days. Still, if you‚Äôre speaking or writing a screed, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre reading a long tedious list.[0m
