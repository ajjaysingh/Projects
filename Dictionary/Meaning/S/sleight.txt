[91m        SHORT  The noun sleight refers to being able to use your hands with ease, especially when doing a trick. Sleight is often used in the phrase "sleight of hand." If

[36m         LONG  The noun sleight refers to cunning or cleverness, especially when used to trick or deceitfully. You can use a sleight of mind to trick yourself into believing
               that if you eat a box of cookies at dinnertime it counts as dinner. The word sleight with its meaning as being sneaky has a long history and
               comes from the Middle English word, sleghth, which also meant cunning. Back then people would have pronounced the "gh" even though today we
               don't.[0m
