[91m        SHORT  A sack is a bag. In some parts of the country, store clerks put your stuff in a sack, but in other parts the same stuff goes in a bag. Sack is also an
               exciting verb.[0m
[36m         LONG  While a sack is often just a bag, as a verb it can do a lot more. A boss might sack, or fire, an employee who‚Äôs no longer needed. In American football, if you
               sack a quarterback, you tackle him. This comes from the other meaning of sack, which is to raid and plunder a town, like when the Visigoths
               sacked Rome. If someone says they‚Äôre going to hit the sack, don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre just going to bed.[0m
