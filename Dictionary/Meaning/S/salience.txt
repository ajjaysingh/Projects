[36m         LONG  Salience comes from the Latin salire, meaning "to leap." Something with salience leaps out at you because it is unique or special in some way. This could be
               an issue ‚Äî like health care reform, or a day ‚Äî like 9/11, or even something someone said ‚Äî like the State of the Union address. If it jumps out
               at you as remarkable or special, it's characterized by a quality of salience.[0m
