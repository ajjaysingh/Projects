[91m        SHORT  A sham is a fake. If you frequently order products advertised on late-night, hour-long television commercials, you‚Äôve probably ended up with at least one item

               He‚Äôs probably a sham, or a quack. Some sources claim that the word sham originated in the 17th century and was derived from the English word
               shame, but who knows? Maybe that theory‚Äôs a sham too.[0m
