[91m        SHORT  If you know someone who's totally addicted to luxurious things and all of life's pleasures, call her a sybarite. Unless she's inviting you over for champagne
               brunches and showering you with gifts — in which case you should keep your mouth shut.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sybarite was first recorded in the 1600s, meaning a “person devoted to pleasure.” The literal translation of this noun is “inhabitant of Sybaris,” which was
               an ancient Greek town full of citizens who loved nice things. Today, the word still has the same two meanings: it's either a person who could
               be described as addicted to pleasures and luxury (like a hedonist), or an actual person who lives in Sybaris.[0m
