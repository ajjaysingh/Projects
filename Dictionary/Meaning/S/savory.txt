[91m        SHORT  Something savory is full of flavor, delicious and tasty ‚Äî usually something that someone has cooked. In the world of cuisine, savory is also often used to
               mean the opposite of sweet, or salty.[0m
[36m         LONG  The easiest way to remember savory is that it rhymes with flavory ‚Äî which is not a real word, but should be. Interestingly, the word unsavory ‚Äî which is
               clearly the opposite of savory ‚Äî is almost never used to describe food. If some a dish doesn't taste good, it, well, isn't good-tasting. If
               something is unsavory, then it's probably a person or situation that seems morally questionable. So, save savory for delicious food and save
               unsavory for things, people and ideas deserving of the adjective.[0m
