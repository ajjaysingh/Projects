[91m        SHORT  Scandal is disgraceful events or nasty gossip about people's private lives, like the scandal that erupted when you were seen at the mall with your best
               friend's girlfriend.[0m
[36m         LONG  Just because there's a scandal, it doesn't mean it's always true ‚Äî being seen with your friend's girl? What the gossips didn't know it that you were buying
               his birthday present. Some scandals, though, involve public figures who have been found guilty. For example, if a politician is found guilty of
               taking bribes, that's a scandal that will rock your town, causing outrage not to mention the end of that politician's career.[0m
