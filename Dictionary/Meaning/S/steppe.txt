[36m         LONG  A steppe, pronounced like the word step, is not quite dry enough to be a desert but not fertile enough for trees to grow.  Think of it as a semi-desert
               covered in grass and shrubs. The word steppe can also be used to describe the climate in areas that are too dry for a forest, but not quite dry
               enough to be desert.[0m
