[91m        SHORT  Stewardship means the management or care of something, particularly the kind that works. If your company is making money, there’s probably been careful

[36m         LONG  The sphere or responsibility of a steward (as in a manager or administrator), stewardship is often used to mean "the care, handling and management of
               resources." Your school requires stewardship to make sure its supplies aren’t stretched. Your clean water may be thanks to the stewardship of
               an environmental office. Though there is a steward on a ship to handle food and supplies, the ship in stewardship is not a seagoing vessel;
               it's just a suffix.[0m
