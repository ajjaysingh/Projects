[91m        SHORT  A sinus infection is when the sinuses near your nose get clogged and your face aches. Good times. That‚Äôs the kind of sinus people talk about, but a sinus is
               any kind of space, cavity, or passage in a person's body.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you hear the word sinus, you probably think of the sinuses that can become infected if you have a bad enough cold. You might get a sinus headache when
               your nose is stuffed up, for example. There are many other sinuses in your body, believe it or not, from the cavernous sinus in your skull to
               the renal sinuses in your kidneys. The word sinus means "bend, fold, or curve" in Latin.[0m
