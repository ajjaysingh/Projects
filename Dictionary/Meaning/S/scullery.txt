[91m        SHORT  You're most likely to see the word scullery in an English novel, since it's a small room off the kitchen, usually in a very old, very British home.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the old days, maids cleaned dishes and utensils ‚Äî and sometimes clothing ‚Äî in the scullery, out of sight of their wealthy employers. In some parts of
               Britain, the word scullery is still used to mean "kitchen," although few people would claim to employ a "scullery maid," or a low-ranking
               member of a household staff. The root of the word is in doubt, but it probably comes from the Latin word for wooden platter, scutra, or the Old
               Norse skola, "to wash."[0m
