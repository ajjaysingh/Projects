[91m        SHORT  You can use saucy to describe someone who likes to cause trouble, but usually in a playful and funny way.  Saucy is also a good word for a person who really
               likes to flirt.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the novel Oliver Twist, the character the Artful Dodger goes to court for stealing.  During his hearing, the ten-year-old screams, ‚ÄúI am an Englishman;
               where are my rights?‚Äù  Saucy words from a saucy child.  A saucy comment makes people gasp because it‚Äôs surprising and a little dangerous, like
               talking about witchcraft in front of a priest.  Saucy also describes a person who flirts with very sexual language, which can be fun, unless
               your grandparents are nearby, which is awkward.[0m
