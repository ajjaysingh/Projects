[91m        SHORT  A person in a stupor is considered barely conscious or stunned; or, if you consult Led Zeppelin lyrics: dazed and confused.[0m
[36m         LONG  Stupors can be brought on by drugs, alcohol, illness, or shocking news. You might doze off with a lampshade on your head if you‚Äôre in a drunken stupor.
               Medically speaking, a person in this state responds only to pain. You can also be in a stupor if you‚Äôre in shock, like if your boss says he's
               replacing you with a robot, or if Mister Ed the talking horse kicks you in the gut. Like stupid, it comes from the Latin word stupere that
               means basically ‚Äúto be stunned.‚Äù[0m
