  SHORT        A stratum is a layer of something, whether abstract, like a social stratum composed of only billionaires, or physical, like the different strata (that’s the
               plural version) of clouds that an airplane passes through.
  LONG         Stratum comes from the Latin meaning "something that has been laid down," like asphalt or a bedsheet, but we generally use it to describe layers of something.
               If you go into geology, you will probably investigate different strata of the soil. If you start out in life poor and try to become rich, you
               are trying to get into a different social stratum.

               small ones.
