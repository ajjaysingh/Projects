[91m        SHORT  Handcuffs are shackles. So are those leg irons some prisoners wear when they appear in court. In other words, a shackle is a restraint, either physical or
               psychological, that restricts movement.[0m
[36m         LONG  We generally think of shackles as some sort of heavy metal cuff that is used to keep prisoners in check. But shackles don't have to be physical. Ignorance can
               be a shackle, so can an abusive family member, or the economy. In those cases, shackles are an external force that keep you from doing or being
               everything you want to. You can't see those shackles, but they can be every bit as confining as the metal cuffs.[0m
