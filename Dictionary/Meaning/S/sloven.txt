[91m        SHORT  A sloven is a disgusting, sloppy person. If you call your messy roommate a sloven, expect him to be offended.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use the noun sloven when you need a good word for a terrible slob. It's not a very common word, but it replaces pig very nicely when you're talking
               about a truly sloppy, unpleasant person. Sloven was first used in the fifteenth century to mean "person with horrible manners." Its origins are
               uncertain, but it probably stems from either the Flemish sloef, "dirty," or slof, which is Dutch for "careless or negligent."[0m
