[91m        SHORT  To sap something is to drain or deplete something over time.  If you sap a maple tree, you drain the liquid inside it to make maple syrup.  But if you sap a
               person of strength, you've rendered him defenseless.[0m
[36m         LONG  Whether used as a noun or verb, sap is rarely a good thing. If your energy or will is sapped, it‚Äôs not meant lightly; it means you have been exhausted of all
               your reserve energy, you‚Äôre reduced to a shell. If someone calls you "a sap," it suggests you lack strength and character. And if you get sap ‚Äî
               the sticky liquid inside a tree ‚Äî on your hands, good luck getting it off in the middle of a forest without a bar of soap and running water.

      Origin:  Old English s√¶p, probably of Germanic origin. The verb (dating from the mid 18th century) is often interpreted as a figurative use of the notion ‚Äòdrain the
               sap from‚Äô, but is derived originally from the verb sap2, in the sense ‚Äòundermine‚Äô.
