[91m        SHORT  A syllogism is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion is gotten from two linked premises. Here‚Äôs an example: An apple is a fruit. All fruit is good.
               Therefore apples are good.[0m
[36m         LONG  Used properly, syllogism can be a good way of reasoning, but it‚Äôs very easy to make sloppy syllogisms by messing up the middle term that links the premises
               together, as in: "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was an Aquarius. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was great. Therefore all Aquariuses
               are great." Because so many are made poorly, the syllogism has a bad reputation. Poor, misleading, or tricky reasoning is often called ‚Äúmere
               syllogism.‚Äù[0m
