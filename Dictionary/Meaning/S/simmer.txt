[91m        SHORT  Usually when you're making a soup, you want to bring it to a boil and then let it simmer, cooking it just below the boiling point to get all the flavors to
               release.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word simmer is usually used to describe the temperature just below boiling or the process of cooking something at that temperature. But it can also be
               used to describe a feeling that's been simmering or slowly developing over time. It's also a word used to describe suppressed anger â€” that
               feeling just before you boil over. Just in case you do boil over, you might need to take a moment to simmer down, a casual expression that
               means, "Chill out, my friend."[0m
