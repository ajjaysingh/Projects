[91m        SHORT  A spectre is a ghost or spirit. If you see a spectre of the previous owners in your new house, get out quick! A spectre can also be a thought that haunts you.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word spectre (or specter) has to do with being haunted — it can be something that literally haunts you, like the ghost of your Aunt Sally who bangs the
               windows every night. You can also say that a reminder of something painful is a spectre. A spectre can also be a fear of something dreadful
               happening in the future, like the spectre of a second ice age. Spectre is generally the British spelling, while Americans prefer specter.[0m
