[91m        SHORT  If your classmate spreads a false rumor that you cheated on the math test, that's slander. Slander is the act of saying an untrue, negative statement about
               someone.[0m
[36m         LONG  In law, the word slander is contrasted with libel, which is the act of making a false written statement about someone. The noun slander is from Old French
               esclandre, escandle, or "scandal," from Late Latin scandalum "stumbling block, offense."[0m
