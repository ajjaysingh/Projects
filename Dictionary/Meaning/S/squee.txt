[91m        SHORT  When you squeeze something, you put pressure on it. If you squeeze your toothpaste from the bottom up, you'll get the most out of your tube.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word squeeze has to do with force or pressure. When you squeeze something, like an orange, you are crushing it to extract juice.  When you squeeze into a
               pair of jeans, you're forcing yourself into them. When you give someone a squeeze, you're giving them a tight hug.  And when you're in a
               squeeze, you're in a tight spot, or a bind.[0m
