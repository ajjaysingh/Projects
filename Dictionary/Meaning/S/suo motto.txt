[91m        SHORT  A motor runs your car, whizzes the blender and gets your golf cart going: it's simply a machine that converts energy into motion.[0m
[36m         LONG  Coming to us from a Latin word that means "to move," motor is certainly connected to the world of motion. Without the innovation of Ford motors, most of
               America wouldn't be able to get anywhere today. These days the motor is undergoing some serious revisions, as engineers look for a way to power
               things with less gasoline and more sunshine.[0m

              	Suo motu , meaning "on its own motion," is a Latin legal term, approximately equivalent to the term sua sponte. For example, it is used where a government
               agency acts on its own cognizance, as in "the Commission took  suo motu  control over the matter."
