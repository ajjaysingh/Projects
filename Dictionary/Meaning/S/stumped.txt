[91m        SHORT  There are three ways to stump: you can ask someone a question they can't answer, you can travel making political speeches, or you can stomp.[0m
[36m         LONG  Stump can mean many things as a verb. The most common use is when someone ‚Äî like a teacher ‚Äî asks a question that no one can answer. That's a case of the
               teacher stumping the class. Also, politicians traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping, giving what are called stump
               speeches. Once in a while, to stump means the same thing as two similar words, stomp and stamp. If you're stumping, stomping, and stamping
               around, you're making a lot of noise with your feet.[0m
