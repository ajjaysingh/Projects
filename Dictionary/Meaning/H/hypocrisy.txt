[91m        SHORT  People who go to church but don't believe in god? People who are vegetarians on a moral basis but wear leather jackets? They are engaging in hypocrisy, or

[36m         LONG  A hypocrite is a person who practices hypocrisy: what they say is not what they do. The noun hypocrisy descends from the Greek hypokrisis "acting on a stage,"
               from hypokrinesthai "to play a part, pretend," from the prefix hypo- "under" plus  krinein "to judge." Many times kids are enraged by their
               parents' hypocrisy when parents make their children follow rules they don't follow themselves.[0m
