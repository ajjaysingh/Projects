[91m        SHORT  When you hobble, you walk awkwardly or unsteadily because you're in pain. You might wipe out on your bike and then hobble back home, pushing it in front of
               you.[0m
[36m         LONG  People who hobble, walking with a limp or a shuffle, have most often been injured in some way, though a disabled or elderly person might hobble as well. You
               can call the walk itself a hobble as well: "I knew that football tackle hurt when I saw your hobble as you left the field." The root of hobble
               is Old English â€” it's related to the Dutch hobbelen, "rock from side to side."[0m
