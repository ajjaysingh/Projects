[91m        SHORT  You can hide your feelings or you can hide your momâ€™s birthday present. You can even hide yourself if you need to avoid someone. Whatever it is, when you hide
               something, you put it out of sight.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hide can mean that you keep something secret, like the way you really feel about your dadâ€™s meatloaf. You can also hide something physical. If you spill juice
               on your white sofa, you can hide the stain with a pillow. Sometimes people hide also â€” that means the person stays out of sight. A bankrobber
               will hide from the police, or you might hide from your mom to avoid doing the dishes.[0m
