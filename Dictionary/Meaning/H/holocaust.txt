[91m        SHORT  The noun holocaust means "total destruction." However, this word has become inextricably connected with World War II and the mass murder of Jews by the Nazis
               (in this usage, Holocaust is capitalized).[0m
[36m         LONG  When holocaust entered the English language in the thirteenth century, it referred to burnt offerings described in the Old Testament. The original Greek word
               meant "burnt whole" (note the relationship to the word caustic). Since at least 1942, though, the word is most often used to describe the
               extermination of Jews by the Nazis. Some people object to the religious connotations of the word, though, preferring to use the Hebrew Shoah
               (catastrophe) instead.[0m
