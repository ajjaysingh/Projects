[91m        SHORT  A harangue is more than a speech, louder than a discussion, and nastier than a lecture. It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or
               received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word harangue developed its modern spelling around 1530, when the word was recorded as harangue in French. The word, meaning a strong, nasty rant, appears
               to have evolved from the Old Italian word aringa, probably from the word for a public square or place for public speaking. This in turn appears
               to have evolved from a Germanic word related to ring, as in "circular gathering," which is clearly similar to the Italian meaning.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English: from Old French arenge, from medieval Latin harenga, perhaps of Germanic origin. The spelling was later altered to conform with French
               harangue (noun), haranguer (verb).
