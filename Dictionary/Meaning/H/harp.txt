[91m        SHORT  A harp is a large, stringed musical instrument with a beautiful sound. If you want to play an instrument that's portable, you should choose a ukulele instead
               of a harp.[0m
[36m         LONG  Many orchestras include a classical harp, which is such a big instrument that players usually need assistance to move them. Harps are played from a sitting
               position, resting on the player's shoulder as she plucks the strings with both hands. A folk harp is often smaller, sometimes sitting on a
               player's lap. When harp is used as a verb, it means to talk constantly and dully about one topic: "The harpist did nothing but harp on about
               the weather."[0m
