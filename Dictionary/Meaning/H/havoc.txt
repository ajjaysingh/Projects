[91m        SHORT  Havoc is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. Havoc often wreaked by hurricanes, angry mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild parties that get out of
               control.[0m
[36m         LONG  If we trace havoc way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people believe that the word comes from the Old French havot, meaning ‚Äúplundering, devastation,‚Äù
               while others argue that it was passed down to us from the Latin habere, meaning ‚Äúto have, possess.‚Äù Either way you look at it, the meaning
               remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction.[0m
