[36m         LONG  This term — along with the related words hedonist and hedonistic — is derived from the Greek word hedone, "pleasure." The Cyreniacs taught that physical
               gratification is superior to the mental satisfaction offered by anticipation and remembrance. That's why hedonistic folks revel in pleasure,
               and demand it in the present tense.[0m
