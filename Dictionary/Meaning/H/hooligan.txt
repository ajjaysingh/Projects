[36m         LONG  This is a slightly old-fashioned word for a troublemaker, especially a violent troublemaker. People who start a fight during a sports event are acting like
               hooligans. In fact, this word is used often for people who start fights at soccer matches, but anyone acting rowdy or obnoxious could be

               them.[0m
