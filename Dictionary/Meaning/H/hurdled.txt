[36m         LONG  When they're doing certain types of races, both human and horse athletes have to leap across hurdles (sometimes other animals do this too, like dogs and even
               rabbits). To do this is also to hurdle. There are physical hurdles, and then there are their figurative counterparts — those difficulties or
               hurdles that prevent you from progressing in your life.[0m
