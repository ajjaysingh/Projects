[91m        SHORT  Do you prefer humans to gods or animals? Well, perhaps you‚Äôre a budding humanist, someone who wants the best for humankind. A humanist is also a scholar of
               the classics and liberal arts.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word humanist comes from the Renaissance, by way of an Italian poet, Lodovico Ariosto. It started out as a name for a scholar of classical Greek and Latin
               literature. It still describes someone who studies liberal arts, or humanities, but now a humanist is also someone who‚Äôs especially interested
               in what's good for humanity. Humanists want everyone to have enough food, shelter, and dignity.[0m
