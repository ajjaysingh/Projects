[91m        SHORT  A heyday is a peak of popularity or success. If you hear someone say "Hey! Back in the day, I was the best boxer in the city! No one could beat me!" he might
               be remembering his heyday as a fighter.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you remember a time in the past when you were doing something really well or getting a lot of attention or fame, you might be reminiscing about your
               heyday. A person or an organization â€” and even a thing â€” can have a heyday, or a peak time when everything goes well. The good news is that a
               heyday can come again and again, so while your heyday as student president might be just a memory, there might be a heyday as governor of your
               state years later.[0m
