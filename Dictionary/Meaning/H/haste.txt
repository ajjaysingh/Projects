[91m        SHORT  When something is done in haste, it's done fast, and often with carelessness. In his haste to finish the paper, he didn't notice he had replaced "taste" with
               "waste" during spell-checking, so his title became "Foods of Our Home State: What a Waste!"[0m
[36m         LONG  The old saying goes "haste makes waste," and when you try to do things too quickly, sometimes you do them wrong or have to do them all over again. You can use
               the noun haste for things done with extraordinary speed and often in a situation where there's pressure to perform or complete a task. "In her
               haste to catch the train she ran six blocks, but when she boarded, she noticed she was wearing one blue tennis shoe and one red one."[0m
