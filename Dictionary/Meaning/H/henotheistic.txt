[36m         LONG  These days the monotheistic religions ‚Äî ones that believe in one god ‚Äî are the most popular. But other religions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, are polytheistic
               ‚Äî meaning they believe in many gods. Usually in a monotheistic religion, God (with a capital G) is an all-powerful being who created the
               universe and knows everything. Monotheistic religions tend to look at other types of believers as pagans, heathens, and heretics.[0m
