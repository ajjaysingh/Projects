[91m        SHORT  A hose is a long plastic or rubber tube that's used for moving a liquid from one place to another. You may use a hose to water your lawn, or to get gas from
               the pump into your car's tank.  Don't use a hose to ingest liquids; use a glass instead.[0m
[36m         LONG  A garden hose is useful for watering plants or washing your car, while firefighters use hoses to spray water on fires. A hose is similar to a pipe, being
               long, narrow, and hollow, with space for liquid to move through it, although a hose is flexible, and a pipe is commonly made of stiff metal or
               hard plastic. You can use the word as a verb, meaning "to spray with a hose," or as a noun meaning "sheer stockings."[0m
