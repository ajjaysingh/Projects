[91m        SHORT  Bad luck, an injury, a mistake, an unfortunate outfit, or a crime ‚Äî anything can be called horrendous if it causes such dread or fear that you can barely even
               think about it.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you‚Äôve ever encountered something horrendous, you won‚Äôt be surprised to learn that the word traces back to the Latin word horrere, meaning "to bristle with
               fear, shudder." That‚Äôs a good way to think about horrendous things ‚Äî they cause you to shudder. You can use the word to describe any type of
               thing ‚Äî people, ideas, actions, and so on ‚Äî but save it for those things that are not merely bad but instead are truly horrifying.[0m
