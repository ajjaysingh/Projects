[36m         LONG  Hostile comes from the Latin word hostis, for enemy, and you can hear its relation to the word hostage.  But you don't have to be from a warring nation to be
               hostile. You can talk about a hostile nation, a hostile takeover, a hostile remark, or a hostile attitude. Some synonyms are inimical,
               antagonistic, unfavorable, unfriendly.[0m
