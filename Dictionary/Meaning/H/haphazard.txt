[91m        SHORT  Anything haphazard is random, disorganized, slipshod, or hit-or-miss. A tent erected haphazardly might look more like a big nylon bag of dirty laundry than a
               place to sleep.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ever heard the expression "I'll hazard a guess?" In it, the word hazard means "chance," as in "take a chance."  Think of the hap in haphazard as short for
               "happen." Combine hap- and -hazard and you get something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you approach a math problem
               with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get it wrong.[0m
