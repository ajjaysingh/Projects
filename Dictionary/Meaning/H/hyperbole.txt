[91m        SHORT  Praising your favorite sports team is one thing, but if you call the team the most incredible group of humans ever to walk the earth, then you're going
               overboard and indulging in hyperbole.[0m
[36m         LONG  The hyper- in hyperbole means "beyond," so it's a good sign that the word has to do with going above and beyond what's necessary. Someone who gets hyperactive
               about something and ends up hyperventilating (breathing too hard) might be prone to the exaggerated style of speaking known as hyperbole. If
               you find yourself talking about the absolutely best (or worst) thing of all time, it's time to take it down a notch and cut down on the
               hyperbole.[0m
