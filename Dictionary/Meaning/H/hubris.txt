[91m        SHORT  Hubris is an excess of confidence: a boxer who shouts "I'm the greatest!" even though he's about to get pummeled by a much stronger opponent is displaying a
               lot of hubris.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hubris is from Greek, where it meant "excessive pride, violating the bounds set for humans" and was always punished by the gods. We no longer have the Greek
               gods, so in English it just refers to over-the-top self-confidence. If you call yourself the best in something, you better have the goods to
               back it up, since too much hubris can lead to embarrassment and humiliation. It's an age-old human failing: pride goeth before the fall.[0m

A condition where the behaviour of politicians, business leaders, and other people in power, changes for the worse as they come to enjoy increasing power and influence. The syndrome causes certain changes to the brains of these leaders which in turn makes them suffer from a number of undesirable qualities; including losing touch with reality, taking excessive pride in their actions, displaying lesser empathy towards other people, and taking arrogant decisions or actions without sufficient thought. The term was coined by former British Foreign Secretary David Owen, who has studied behavioural changes in various world leaders, in his 2007 book by the same name.
