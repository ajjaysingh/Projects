[91m        SHORT  Your summer cabin deep in the woods where you go to think about how funny life is sometimes? If you want to sound fancy, it could be called a hermitage, a
               dwelling removed from civilization.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun hermitage has origins in the French word hermite, meaning “hermit,” a person who lives alone, far from society. Hermitage can describe the place
               where a hermit lives, or a dwelling occupied by an isolated religious group that prefers solitude. But the word is likely to be used more
               broadly to describe a secluded or remote dwelling, a place of solitude, where you won’t run into a neighbor while mowing the lawn in the
               backyard.[0m
