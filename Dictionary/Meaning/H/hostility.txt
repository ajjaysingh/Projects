[36m         LONG  Hostility can be used to describe aggressive relations between two countries as well as between people. The issue of territorial borders can often cause
               hostility between neighboring countries. If actual fighting breaks out, use the word hostilities to refer to the violent actions between them.
               The ordinary citizens of the countries involved will look forward to the end of hostilities when the two governments are able to work together
               for peace.[0m
