[91m        SHORT  Someone who is haughty is arrogant and full of pride. When you're haughty, you have a big attitude and act like you're better than other people.[0m
[36m         LONG  A haughty person acts superior and looks down on others. Haughty people are disdainful, overbearing, prideful, swaggering, and obnoxious. Acting amazed that
               others haven't heard of a hot new band is haughty. Speaking in a cocky or superior way is haughty. The word even sounds a little like its
               meaning: it's hard to say haughty without sounding like you have an attitude. If you're acting like others are beneath you, you're being
               haughty.[0m
