[91m        SHORT  Hysterical means "marked by uncontrollable, extreme emotion." If your favorite sports team wins a championship, you might get  hysterical and started weeping
               and screaming all at once.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hysterical comes from the medical Latin word hystericus, which described a female neurotic condition, thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.
               Hysterical is still used today by psychiatrists, though in a broader way, to describe someone suffering from a psychological stress condition.
               Hysterical can also mean "extremely funny," even more so than hilarious.[0m
