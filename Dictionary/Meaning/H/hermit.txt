[91m        SHORT  You hear about hermits more often than you meet one, and that‚Äôs because a hermit is someone who likes to be alone, far from people, sometimes because of their
               religious beliefs or maybe because they simply want some privacy.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hermits like living solo, alone in the woods, up in a mountain, or sometimes they live in a city without hardly ever leaving their apartment.  The root of the
               word is the Greek erƒìmos, meaning ‚Äúsolitary.‚Äù  A life of solitude isn‚Äôt for everyone, but a hermit chooses it for any number of reasons.  For
               example, being able to honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity are two possible motivations to become a hermit.[0m
