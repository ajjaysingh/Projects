[36m         LONG  If you hurl a rock at a glass window, it will probably break, and if you hurl your trash in the direction of a garbage can, it may or may not land inside. The
               verb hurl implies some force behind your throw. The earliest English version was hurlen, which in the thirteenth century meant "run against
               each other or collide." It probably comes from the Germanic root hurr, which is also the root of hurry, and means "rapid motion."[0m
