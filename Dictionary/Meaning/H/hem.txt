[91m        SHORT  When kids grow taller, their parents sometimes have to let out the hem in their pants so they'll be long enough. The hem is the very bottom, folded edge of a
               piece of clothing.[0m
[36m         LONG  Most of your clothes have at least one hem in them ‚Äî at the ends of your sleeves, the bottom of your skirt, or along the edge of your t-shirt. When a person
               sews a hem, whether he's making a dress or a pair of curtains, he folds a very small amount of fabric under two or three times and stitches
               along the edge in a straight line. In Old English, the word hem means "a border."[0m
