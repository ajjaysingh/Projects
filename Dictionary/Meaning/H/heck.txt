[91m        SHORT  To heckle is to challenge or harass someone. At a sporting event, fans sometimes heckle the opposing team, but it‚Äôs not very respectable behavior.[0m
[36m         LONG  One of the many challenges of being a stand-up comedian is dealing with people harassing you from the audience. Those people are heckling. While heckling in a
               comedy club is not all that unusual, it‚Äôs still rude. If you choose to heckle someone, whether they are a comic or anyone else, be prepared to
               be heckled back ‚Äî or worse.[0m
