[91m        SHORT  Humbug is language that's either deceptive or just ridiculous. Either way, it's verbal garbage and inspires people to mutter "Bah! Humbug!" ‚Äî just like
               Scrooge did in "A Christmas Carol."[0m
[36m         LONG  Humbug is one of many words in English for language that can't be trusted. Humbug is like snake oil: it's deceptive, tricky, and meant to put one over on you.
               There's a slightly different type of humbug that refers to nonsense: speech or writing that's silly, pretentious, or just empty. When someone
               is talking a lot but saying nothing, they're talking humbug.[0m
