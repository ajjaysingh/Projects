[91m        SHORT  The hinterlands are affectionately called "the sticks," or the "boonies," short for "boondocks." Use it to specify an area that is far away from a city or
               town, or even civilization as we know it.  Cell-phone reception and cable television aren't guaranteed.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun hinterland comes to the English language via Germany:  hinter is "behind" + land is, well, "land." It actually refers to the land lying inland ‚Äî or
               behind ‚Äî an ocean coast or river shore, which is why backwaters  and hinterlands are used interchangeably. Use hinterlands when you want to
               make fun of an area's backwardness, or to celebrate its natural beauty: "Coming from the unspoiled hinterlands of Louisiana, she found it hard
               to adjust to the sights and sounds of the big city."[0m
