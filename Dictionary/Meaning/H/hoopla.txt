[91m        SHORT  When people get too excited about something, you can describe it as hoopla. Your family may want to make a lot of hoopla on your birthday, while you'd prefer
               a quiet dinner at home.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hoopla is when someone goes overboard getting excited about something. A company may raise a lot of hoopla about a new product that's actually kind of boring,
               and a teacher's hoopla about the class Halloween party might seem silly if she teaches twelfth grade physics rather than kindergarten. The word
               hoopla has been around since at least the 1800's, although it was originally spelled houp-la, and it was first used as an exclamation similar
               to oopsie daisy.[0m
