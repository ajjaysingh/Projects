[91m        SHORT  In a football game, a huddle is a quick conference before a play. Huddle can also be a dense and disorganized crowd, like a group of people standing under an
               awning waiting for the rain to pass.[0m
[36m         LONG  As a verb huddle means to draw people together or to crouch low or curl up. The word comes from the late 16th century, when it meant “to conceal.” That makes
               sense. When a burglar comes into your home, you might huddle in the closet so he'll leave without harming you. When your mom comes to see if
               you’re sleeping, you might huddle under your blankets with your flashlight so she won’t know you’re still up reading.[0m
