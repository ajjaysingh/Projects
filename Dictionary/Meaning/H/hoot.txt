[91m        SHORT  A hoot is the musical call an owl makes. The hoot of an owl sounds very much like the word hoot.[0m
[36m         LONG  An owl's hoot is the inspiration for a similar sound that people make to show disapproval or scorn: "The sound of the crowd's hoots filled the stadium when
               the soccer player kicked the ball into his own team's goal." To make this sound, whether you're a person or an owl, is to hoot, and if you
               don't give a hoot, it means you really don't care at all.[0m
