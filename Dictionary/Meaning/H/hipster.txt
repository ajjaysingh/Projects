[91m        SHORT  A hipster is someone whose fashion choices and music interests fall outside the mainstream. Instead of following popular trends, hipsters generally favor
               alternative lifestyles, progressive politics, and quirky clothing.[0m
[36m         LONG  The meaning of the word hipster has evolved since it was coined in the early 1940s to describe jazz musicians and fans, from the jazz slang term hep, "up to
               date." In the 1960s, hipster mainly referred to low-slung, hip-hugging pants, but by the 1990s it described an urban subculture made up mostly
               of young and educated bohemian types living in gentrified neighborhoods.[0m
