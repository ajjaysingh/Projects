[91m        SHORT  Being attacked by a hungry shark or being chased by an unruly mob on the streets can be described as harrowing, which means "provoking feelings of fear or
               horror."[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective harrowing is often used to describe a firsthand experience that is terrifying, such as a harrowing drive home in icy weather, but it can also
               refer to a secondhand experience, such as reading or watching something that is very frightening or disturbing. If you read someone‚Äôs account
               of being shipwrecked in Antarctica, you might describe that as a harrowing story. A harrowing experience typically unfolds over a period of
               time. For example, if you bump into a shark while swimming, that‚Äôs merely scary. If the shark attacks you, then it becomes a harrowing ordeal.[0m
