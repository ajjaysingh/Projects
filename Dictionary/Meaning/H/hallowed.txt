[91m        SHORT  The adjective hallowed is used to describe something that is sacred and revered, usually something old and steeped in tradition.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word hallowed often has a religious connotation, but it can also be used playfully to convey a sense of reverence about something that isn‚Äôt religious in
               nature but that nonetheless inspires worship. A football fan, for example, may talk about the hallowed tradition of tailgating on a game day
               Saturday, or an avid shopper may describe the hallowed grounds of the Macy‚Äôs shoe department. In the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln used the word
               with its more traditional sense to ponder man's inability to show the proper reverence to those men who died in battle: "But, in a larger
               sense, we cannot dedicate‚Ä¶we cannot consecrate‚Ä¶we cannot hallow‚Ä¶this ground."[0m
