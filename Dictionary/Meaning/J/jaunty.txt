[36m         LONG  A jaunty hat is one that's stylish and cheerful at the same time, a quality that can be accentuated if the person wears it in a jaunty fashion, perhaps off to
               the side or over one eye. Playing the part of a jaunty person is easy if you're feeling upbeat and chipper and want the world to know it.
               Elves are often jaunty in their own way. Sporting their spiffy outfits and featuring that trademark cheerful spring in their step. The fact

               with the jaunty little guys.[0m
