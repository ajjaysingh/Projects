[91m        SHORT  You want a word that‚Äôs a whole mouthful? Try jurisprudence, the study and philosophy of law. You want to study jurisprudence? Get ready for law school, where
               you‚Äôll find even longer, more troubling words.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin-based word jurisprudence is made up of two parts, juris "of law" and prudence which goes back to mean "knowledge." If you study law, you study
               jurisprudence. You can modify it to show a specific type of law, so you will find terms such as medical, human rights, Islamic or American
               jurisprudence. Sometimes the word is used as a collective to mean the legal world. This is a new issue that jurisprudence will have to deal
               with.[0m
