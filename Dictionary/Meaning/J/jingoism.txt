[91m        SHORT  Jingoism is fanatical, over-the-top patriotism. If you refuse to eat, read, wear, or discuss anything that wasn't made in your own country, people might
               accuse you of jingoism.[0m
[36m         LONG  Jingoism comes from the word jingo, the nickname for a group of British people who always wanted to go to war to prove the superiority of Britain. Now we use
               jingoism for that kind of aggressive, chauvinistic behavior in any country, or for things intended to stir up war-thirst and blind patriotism.
               If you see a TV show tries to get viewers to support a military cause without a critical look at whether war is necessary, call it jingoism.[0m
