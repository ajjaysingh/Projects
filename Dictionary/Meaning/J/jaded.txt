[91m        SHORT  If you've done something so much that it doesn't excite you anymore but just leaves you tired, consider yourself jaded. If someone says you look a little
               jaded, it just means that you look tired.[0m
[36m         LONG  The history of jaded is not clear, but perhaps it is related to the noun jade, an old term for a worn-out horse. Even if not, picturing a tired old horse may
               be a nice way to remember that jaded means dulled or tired from too much of something. The word can also mean cynical because of bad
               experiences with something, like a jaded journalist who doesn't see the person behind the politician.[0m
