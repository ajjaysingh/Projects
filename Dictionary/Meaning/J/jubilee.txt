[91m        SHORT  A jubilee is the celebration of the anniversary of a special event, or it‚Äôs the anniversary itself. Which basically means it‚Äôs a birthday party.[0m
[36m         LONG  Here‚Äôs something you might not know: the word jubilee comes from the Hebrew word yobel, which means ‚Äúram‚Äôs horn trumpet.‚Äù If you‚Äôve ever celebrated the Jewish
               New Year, it‚Äôs possible you've heard a ram‚Äôs horn trumpet played to mark the jubilee. In Judaism, the Jubilee Year is a year of freedom from
               enslavement which is celebrated every fifty years. But that horn gets played every year. What‚Äôs a jubilee without a ram‚Äôs horn trumpet?[0m
