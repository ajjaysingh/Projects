[91m        SHORT  When someone starts to jabber, they start talking on and on about this or that, or that or this, in an excited, sometimes incoherent way. Jabber is a close
               cousin to blabber.[0m
[36m         LONG  When someone jabbers, sometimes their words seem to fly out of their mouths like quick punches (jabs!) from a boxer. Some examples of jabber? You know, like
               when someone has a hobby that you don‚Äôt really care about or understand but they won‚Äôt quit talking about it? Yeah, they jabber. Or your best
               friend is relating, without end, his excitement about the coming tiddlywinks championship and you comprehend neither the game nor its
               importance? That friend jabbers, too.[0m
