[36m         LONG  When someone refers to their kith and kin, she means her friends and family. Both words date back to Old English, kin reaching back to the 700s. Originally
               referring to one‚Äôs family or race, kin narrowed to refer just to one‚Äôs blood relations. Your "next of kin" is your closest family member:
               spouse, child, parent, or sibling.[0m
