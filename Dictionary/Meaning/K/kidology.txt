[36m         LONG  Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies. But not all -ism words are. Think: cronyism (a system of graft whereby friends unfairly help
               each other make money.) Our English noun is from French id√©ologie. The suffix ‚Äìlogy, used with many English words describing theories or
               doctrines, is from Greek logos "word, reason, speech, account."[0m
