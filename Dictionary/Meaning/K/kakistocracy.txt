[91m        SHORT  A person who's "born to rule" belongs to the ruling class, or aristocracy, and is "noble" just by being in the family line â€” whether they have done anything
               noble or not. In an aristocracy, a princess who doesnâ€™t visit sick children or clear land mines is still a princess.[0m
[36m         LONG  "Rule of the best" or "by a privileged class" are 16th-century Latin meanings for aristocracy. There are examples of the "best" coming from ordinary society,
               no matter who their parents are, but often the aristocracy is made up of families who start ruling and keep the power in the family generation
               after generation. Kings and queens, princes and princesses, and dukes and earls, are all titles within an aristocracy, though some really hard-
               working and noble outsiders may earn a spot in the aristocracy too.[0m
