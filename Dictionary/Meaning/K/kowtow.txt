[91m        SHORT  Kowtow, which describes the act of kneeling and touching one‚Äôs head to the ground to show respect, used to be a custom in Chinese culture. Now it refers to
               acting like you're doing that, whether you actually bow or not.[0m
[36m         LONG  Kowtow is derived from the Chinese word k‚Äôo-t‚Äôou, which literally means ‚Äúknock the head.‚Äù As a verb, kowtow has the sense of ‚Äúsucking up‚Äù or "flattering."
               Maybe you‚Äôre wondering when it would be appropriate to kowtow. The answer? When you want to worship, show respect, gain favor, or flatter. You
               might need to kowtow to your teacher if you failed a test, but if you kowtow to all your neighbor's requests, you might wind up mowing his lawn
               all summer.[0m
