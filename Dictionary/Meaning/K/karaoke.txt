[91m        SHORT  Karaoke is a type of entertainment where people sing popular songs to prerecorded music, usually in bars.[0m
[36m         LONG  Like the haiku, karaoke was invented in Japan. This form of entertainment is very popular in the United States, where people sing karaoke every day. It's a
               chance to sing a song you love without having a band: you can just get up and belt it out. Usually, the lyrics are displayed too, so you don't
               even have to remember the words. A lot of people would probably rather die than sing karaoke, but lots of people can't get enough.[0m
