[91m        SHORT  In Jewish law, food must be ritually cleaned and prepared in order to be kosher, or fit to eat. Today, it can also mean anything that is proper or legitimate.

[36m         LONG  The word kosher, literally meaning ‚Äúclean‚Äù or ‚Äúpure,‚Äù refers to food that has been ritually prepared or blessed so it can be eaten by religious Jews. It comes
               from the Hebrew word kasher, meaning "proper" or "lawful," and became common in English in the mid-19th Century.  It can be used as an
               adjective, for example, "kosher meat." In the mid-1920's, the word took on a more general meaning, used to refer to anything that was
               acceptable.[0m
