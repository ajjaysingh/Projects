[91m        SHORT  A vantage is a really good place from which to survey a scene. You might find that the roof of the house offers an excellent vantage from which to drop water

[36m         LONG  Vantage is a variation of advantage, but when we use vantage we‚Äôre almost always talking about a position, not just general superiority. If you had extra
               tutoring for a big exam, you would have the advantage over a classmate who didn‚Äôt. But if your seat for the test allowed you to see the answer
               sheet lying on the desk, well then you would have a superior vantage ‚Äî not that you would take advantage of that, of course![0m
