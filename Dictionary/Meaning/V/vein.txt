[91m        SHORT  A vein is a blood vessel. If you've ever donated blood, you know that having a needle put in your vein by a health care worker is not nearly as scary as it
               sounds.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although it mainly describes part of the body's circulatory system, vein can also refer to a pattern that looks like a vein in your body. For example, you can
               describe the streaks of color that run through blue cheese as veins of greenish-blue. Similarly, a theme or idea that continues appearing
               throughout a book could be called a vein. The trickiest thing about the word vein is trying not to confuse it with its homophones ‚Äî vane (as in
               weather vane) and vain (as in conceited).[0m
