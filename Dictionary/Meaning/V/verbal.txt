[91m        SHORT  If your friend tells you that the speech you just made was really verbal, he means you used too many words, overstated the point, went on too long, were

               Sometimes we use verbal to mean "spoken instead of written," usually to talk about agreements we've made. A child who is verbal is a child who
               can speak, and we call someone who's very articulate a verbal person.[0m
