[91m        SHORT  Vestigial describes an organ or body part that continues to exist without retaining its original function, such as our appendix.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective vestigial derives from the Latin word vestigium, meaning "footprint, trace." It's most often used in biology to describe something that either
               didn't finish developing or has become, through evolution, pretty much useless. An ostrich's wings are vestigial because it's unable to fly —
               or do much of anything — with them. A penguin's wings, on the other hand, are not vestigial because it has found another use for them — to help
               it swim.[0m
