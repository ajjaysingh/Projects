[91m        SHORT  Vermin is a catch-all term that can be used for any small animals or insects that we think of as pests. The cockroaches you found in your bathroom were the
               grossest vermin you'd ever seen.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word vermin originally came from the Anglo-French word of the same spelling, meaning "noxious animals" — definitely a negative term. Rats, mice,
               cockroaches, along with pests to farmers and the animals they raise, like coyotes and weasels, are vermin. Annoying people who cause problems
               are also sometimes called vermin, like the vermin who bully others.[0m
