[91m        SHORT  Vicious is an adjective that means intentionally harmful or nasty. If you spread vicious rumors about a person, you're telling people things that will hurt
               her feelings or ruin her reputation. Cut it out![0m
[36m         LONG  If you're described as vicious, you're someone who does brutal things on purpose, out of ill-will towards others, like beating up defenseless puppies or
               poisoning the drinking water for a town. You're worse than just mean if you are vicious ‚Äî in fact, you're evil! People (and puppies) will be
               wise to keep their distance. Other things, like gossip, animals, or cars from horror movies can be vicious, too.[0m
