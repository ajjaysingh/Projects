[36m         LONG  Another word for voluptuary is hedonist, someone whose favorite things are comfort and luxury, and whose highest priority is sensual pleasure. A voluptuary
               might be especially fond of fine clothing, delicious food, and a luxurious home. The Latin root of voluputary is voluptas, which means
               "pleasure," and that is exactly what a voluptuary is preoccupied with, his or her own pleasure.[0m
