[36m         LONG  Have you ever found it especially hard to interrupt someone who talks a lot when he or she gets on a roll? If so, it won‚Äôt surprise you that the adjective
               voluble traces back to the Latin word volvere, meaning ‚Äúto roll.‚Äù The word voluble describes talking continuously, fluently, at great length,
               in a steady flow. You‚Äôll know it when you meet voluble talkers: they just keep rolling on and on.[0m

      Origin:  Middle English (in senses ‚Äòrotating about an axis‚Äô and ‚Äòhaving a tendency to change‚Äô): from French, or from Latin volubilis, from volvere ‚Äòto roll‚Äô. The
               modern meanings arose in the late 16th century.
