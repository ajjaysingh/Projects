[91m        SHORT  You know how some furniture looks like solid oak or maple until it gets chipped and reveals itself to be nothing more than some cheap particle-board covered
               with a thin layer of fancy wood?  That thin layer is called a veneer.[0m
[36m         LONG  A veneer can be anything that makes something look more elegant or attractive than it is. Originally it was a furniture word, but over time its meaning
               expanded.  If someone smiles at you while making some passive-aggressive remark, like, "Gee, you actually look really nice today," you could
               say that her inner meanness is showing through her veneer of sweetness.[0m
