[91m        SHORT  Verbiage is what it sounds like ‚Äî a lot of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and all the other parts of speech. Usually, verbiage means a few too many words ‚Äî
               like the excessive verbiage in a legal document.[0m
[36m         LONG  Verbiage comes from the 18th-century French verbier, meaning "to chatter." Verbiage can mean just the words being used to communicate, or a bunch of empty
               words used to obscure communication. Someone long-winded might receive a sarcastic "compliment" about his verbiage, while another speaker might
               receive genuine applause for intelligent verbiage, or choice of words.[0m
