[91m        SHORT  It is no fun hanging out with vindictive people, who are forever out to get back at people they think have hurt them. If you forget to say hello to them one
               day in the hall, they will carry a grudge against you into next week.[0m
[36m         LONG  Vindictive is often paired with mean, as in "the atmosphere of the cheerleading squad at my new school was vindictive and mean and I wanted nothing to do with
               it." Vindictive rumors show a spirit full of revenge. Vindictive is from Latin vindicta "revenge." The related Latin verb vindicare has the
               very different meaning "to defend or clear someone from guilt," and this is the source of the English verb vindicate.[0m
