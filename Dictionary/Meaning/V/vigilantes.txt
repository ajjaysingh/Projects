[91m        SHORT  If you’re a vigilante, you might take the law into your own hands by trying to catch or punish someone in your own way. If you wrestle jaywalkers down to the
               ground, you might be called a vigilante.[0m
[36m         LONG  Vigilante is a form of the word "vigilant," which means keeping a watchful or close eye on events and people. Sometimes a vigilante will make news for
               catching a criminal, and sometimes vigilante groups form to target crimes in a bad neighborhood. A common combined use is "vigilante justice,"
               meaning a form of law-keeping outside of the official channels of police and the courts.[0m
