[91m        SHORT  When something is viable, it has the ability to grow or function properly. A viable seed can develop into a plant, while a viable company has the resources to
               succeed.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective viable refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin roots vita which means "life," and the ending
               -able which means "to be possible." In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a
               cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable airplane after many tries and spectacular
               failures.[0m
