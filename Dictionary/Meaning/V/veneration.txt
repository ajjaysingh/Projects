[91m        SHORT  Veneration is similar to worship or respect: we feel veneration for things and people we adore and are devoted to completely.[0m
[36m         LONG  This is a strong word. The main meaning is for a type of religious zeal: if you unquestionably believe in your religion, then you feel and show veneration for
               your god and beliefs. Also, veneration can apply outside religion when you have enormous respect for something or someone. Great people like
               Martin Luther King or Mother Theresa inspire veneration. If you feel a combination of awe and love for someone, you are full of veneration.[0m
