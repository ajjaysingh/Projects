[91m        SHORT  The valedictorian is usually the student with the highest grades in a class. If the valedictorian of your class is someone you like and admire, you'll enjoy
               listening to her graduation speech.[0m
[36m         LONG  At a high school or university graduation, the valedictorian traditionally gives a farewell speech, called a valedictory. This person is almost always the
               student in the class with the very best academic record. The origin of the word valedictorian is the Latin valedicere, which means bid
               farewell. Valedicere in turn comes from valere, be well, and dicere, to say.[0m
