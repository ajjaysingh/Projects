[91m        SHORT  The noun viability means the quality of being able to happen or having a reasonable chance of success. The viability of holding your party at a restaurant
               might depend on how many guests they can seat.[0m
[36m         LONG  Viability comes from the Latin root vita, meaning "life." So the noun viability also refers to something's capacity to live and grow. When your dog has a
               litter of puppies, you can't help wondering about the viability of the tiniest one, but if you feed him with an eyedropper and keep him warm,
               he might make it.[0m
