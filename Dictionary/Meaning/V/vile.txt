[91m        SHORT  Surely only an evil person could be so vile as to have made you so angry. Vile is something or someone so morally wrong or offensive as to be thoroughly

[36m         LONG  Are you appalled by someone‚Äôs sordid, despicable, ugly and just generally awful behavior? Then it‚Äôs probably vile, too. One of those dramatic adjectives with
               many synonyms, the word vile is not only used to describe a person or an action that is morally reprehensible; it can describe a smell that is
               so bad as to be practically morally reprehensible ‚Äî or something else that offends your senses enough to make you nauseous. Those three month
               old dirty gym socks? They‚Äôre vile![0m
