[36m         LONG  Vex can be used as an adjective: for example, a vexing issue is not easily solved. The verb vex, the corresponding adjective vexatious, and the noun vexation
               are all slightly old-fashioned though still in current use. Vex descends from Middle English vexen, from Middle French vexer, from Latin vexare
               "to shake, attack, trouble."[0m
