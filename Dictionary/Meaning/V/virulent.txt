[91m        SHORT  A virulent disease is one that's infectious, spreading, and making lots of people sick, while a virulent rant is just a verbal attack, causing sickness of the
               emotional kind. Either way, something virulent puts a strain on the people who get it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Two meanings come out of the roots for virulent: one being "poisonous" and the other, "spiteful." The virus-carrying meaning of virulent often gets combined
               with strain, such as in a "virulent strain of the flu." Those who aren‚Äôt carrying disease but are still considered virulent most likely lash
               out at others with a biting tone. Unleashing acid-tongued words on someone would be considered a virulent attack.[0m
