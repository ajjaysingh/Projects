[91m        SHORT  Vis-a-vis is a fancy way of saying "in regard to" or "compared to," as in: "He was substantially underpaid vis-a-vis other researchers."[0m
[36m         LONG  Technically that "a" in vis-a-vis is an "√†" as the phrase translates literally from the French for "face to face." There's a slightly pedantic ring to the
               term vis-a-vis so use it with caution. It's more a term that might be used in a newspaper article or academic treatise, and something best
               avoided in speech altogether, unless you're deliberately aiming for comic effect.[0m
