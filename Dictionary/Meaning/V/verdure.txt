[36m         LONG  Verdure is related to many words for the color green, and that's exactly what it means: greenery, and a lot of it, in nature. This word conveys a sense of
               life: think of a park where there's green everywhere you see. That's verdure. A forest will have even more verdure, and you could find verdure
               in someone's garden, if it's a big one with a lot of plants. Verdure is so brightly alive that it makes people feel good.[0m
