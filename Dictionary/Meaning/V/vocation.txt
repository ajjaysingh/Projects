[91m        SHORT  Unless you can find someone to pay you to sip fancy tropical drinks on the beach, your vocation is not likely to be a "vacation." Rather, the word means
               something you know how to do‚Äì‚Äìor what you do for a living.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word vocation derives from the Latin vocare "to call." To become a priest, you need to feel that you have been "called" to the ministry directly by God.
               Their job is their calling, or vocation. An avocation is something you do because you love it. Everyone should make it their goal to have their
               avocation become their vocation.[0m
