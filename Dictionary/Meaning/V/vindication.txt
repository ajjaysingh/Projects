[91m        SHORT  Vindication is a sweet thing тАФ when you get vindication, you've been proven right or justified in doing something. Everyone accused of a crime craves
               vindication.[0m
[36m         LONG  Vindication is good, but it can only come after something bad, like being accused of something you didn't do. If a teacher thought you cheated, but then
               announced to the whole class that you didn't, you're getting vindication. An accused criminal who is exonerated тАФ cleared of the crime тАФ gets
               vindication. If you believe something crazy тАФ like that your underdog sports team could win a championship тАФ and it comes true, that's a
               vindication of your beliefs.[0m
