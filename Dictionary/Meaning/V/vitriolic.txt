[36m         LONG  Vitriolic is an adjective related to the noun vitriol — which means a metal sulphate. However, you will most likely NOT hear vitriolic used to describe a
               chemical reaction. You are more likely to hear vitriolic used to describe caustic words. We've seen some examples in recent political
               campaigns, and the results are always embarrassing. Avoid using vitriolic language whenever possible, and you will keep your friends — and your
               dignity.[0m
