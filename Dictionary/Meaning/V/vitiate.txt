[91m        SHORT  As some sneaky five-year-olds know, crossing oneтАЩs fingers while making a promise is an effective way to vitiate, or destroy the validity of, an agreement.[0m
[36m         LONG  Vitiate is often used when a legal agreement is made invalid, but it can also refer to the debasement or corruption of something or someone. If a malicious
               five-year-old on the playground teaches the other children to lie with their fingers crossed, she would be responsible for vitiating the
               playground community. The first syllable of this word is pronounced "vish," like the first syllable in vicious.[0m
