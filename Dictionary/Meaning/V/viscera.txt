[91m        SHORT  If someone calls you a gutless coward, he's telling you that you lack both courage and viscera. Your viscera are your innards or your guts. In popular usage
               the term refers to the intestines, but technically it includes all soft internal organs.[0m
[36m         LONG  Viscera comes from the Latin viscus, meaning "an inner part of the body." You won't hear it much nowadays unless you're studying anatomy or describing
               particularly gory special effects. (Parents object to ultra-violent videogames where bodies explode, spewing viscera.) Don't confuse it with
               the related visceral, which does crop up often today and means "instinctive." "She had a visceral reaction to seeing her boyfriend and his
               hunting pals covered in deer blood and viscera, and dumped him the next day."[0m
