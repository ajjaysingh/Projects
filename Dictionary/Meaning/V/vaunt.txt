[91m        SHORT  To vaunt is to brag and boast and flaunt and go on and on about how great something is. It's over-the-top showing off, and when you taunt and exaggerate your
               greatness, you vaunt to the point of no longer seeming so great.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the Latin vƒÅnitƒÅre ‚Äî which comes from vƒÅnus, meaning "vain" or "empty" ‚Äî vaunt is a verb for taking praise too far or talking something up too much. Even
               if it's earned or deserved bragging, vaunting about something gets old and loses it impact. Other times, vaunt, as a noun, is a sure sign that
               a hard sell is going on ‚Äî someone is talking big but can't deliver.[0m
