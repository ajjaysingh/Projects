[91m        SHORT  Use the adverb verily when you need an old-fashioned way to say "certainly." For example, you might say, "I verily believe that's the ugliest sweater I've
               ever seen."[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use the word verily to mean "truthfully," although people may not know what you're talking about, since it's mostly found in very old-fashioned
               writing, from the Bible to Shakespeare. In fact, Shakespeare is probably the writer most associated with the word verily: "Verily, I swear,
               'tis better to be lowly born," he writes in "Henry VIII." The root is Middle English combination of very and ly, originally verraily.[0m
