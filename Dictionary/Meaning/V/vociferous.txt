[36m         LONG  Vociferous is from the Latin vociferari meaning "to shout, yell." If you break it down to the first part, take vox meaning "voice" and add it to ferre meaning
               "to carry," then vociferous describes voices that carry; you can hear a vociferous person from across the room at a dance party. Vociferous
               isn't just loud, but annoying, too, like when the vociferous fans of the opposing team chant insults in unison. Try yanking a cookie out of a
               little kid's hand if you want to hear a vociferous reaction.[0m
