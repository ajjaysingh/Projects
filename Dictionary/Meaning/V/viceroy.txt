[91m        SHORT  A viceroy is appointed by a king to be in charge of a country or province.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a country is ruled by a monarch — a king or queen — and controls colonies or provinces, the monarch can’t govern all those remote areas personally.
               That's where a viceroy comes in. The king or queen appoints a representative to rule over the colony or province. This viceroy is the most
               powerful person in this region, kind of like a king or president. The difference is that the viceroy has to answer to the monarch, his boss
               back in the mother country.[0m
