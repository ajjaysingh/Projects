[91m        SHORT  If you make a deal with your brother to change the oil in his car in exchange for one of his video games, what you‚Äôve just done is barter ‚Äî or trade goods and
               services.[0m
[36m         LONG  Before money was invented, people traded goods and services in order to acquire the things they needed. An individual might trade, for example, a cow in
               exchange for help building a shed, or a dozen eggs in exchange for several yards of cloth. To this day people continue to barter for goods and
               services although this method of commerce is no longer widespread. The verb barter has survived into modern times to refer to making a
               transaction that involves the exchange of goods or services rather than money.[0m
