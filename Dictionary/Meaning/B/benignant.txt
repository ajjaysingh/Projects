[91m        SHORT  Someone who's benignant is goodhearted and kind. Your favorite teacher in elementary school was probably the most benignant of them all.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you're describing a lovely, warm person you can call her benignant, or even describe someone with a particularly sweet face as looking benignant. Another
               way to use this adjective is as a less common way to say "benign," or not harmful, especially in a medical sense — a benignant tumor, for
               example, is one that won't hurt you. Benignant, in fact, comes from benign, simply adding the ant on the model of malignant, or "dangerous,
               infectious, or cancerous."[0m
