  SHORT        To batter is to beat repeatedly, as if one boxer were clobbering another with blows.
  LONG         Batter is one of those words with many meanings that seem entirely unrelated to each other. You can batter by hitting again and again, but there's also a
               batter in baseball — the guy who's holding a bat and waiting for the pitcher to throw the ball. Yet another meaning is the batter you mix up
               when you're making muffins, using eggs, flour, milk, and sugar. They all come from the same Latin root word, battuere, "to beat or strike."

     >         The Bernie people are battering the Democrats with “if only’s” and “I told you so’s.”
     >         Other equipment, like battering rams and riot helmets and shields, are still available under the program but require more justification to obtain them.
     >         There’s a glimmer of good news in the battered market for personal computers: The PC isn’t dead yet.
     >         Closer relations with the United States have helped, and backsliding on the thaw could further weaken Cuba's economy, already battered by low commodity
               prices.
     >         The officers also told dispatchers that the woman was heavily battered.
