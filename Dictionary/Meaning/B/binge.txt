[91m        SHORT  A binge is a brief period of doing something excessively. You might celebrate your birthday by indulging in a banana cream pie binge if that's your very

[36m         LONG  Binge rhymes with fringe. If you give in to your urges and really indulge yourself, you binge on something, whether it's candy, video games, or shopping.
               There's an implied sense in the word binge that you're doing too much of something that isn't very good for you in the first place. Binge is
               also a verb, as in people who binge on television, watching show after show.[0m
