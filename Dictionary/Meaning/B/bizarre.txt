[91m        SHORT  Someone or something bizarre is odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa, lime-green cowboy
               boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, "How bizarre!"[0m
[36m         LONG  Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro "angry, fierce, strange," from
               Spanish, "bold, like a knight." The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque bizar "a beard," since beards were taken as signs of energy
               and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre ‚Äî like when your
               little brother decides that he will communicate only in Pig Latin.[0m
