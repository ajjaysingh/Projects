[36m         LONG  When you think of a battery, you probably envision the electrical devices that allow you to power everything in your life ‚Äî from your car to your cell phone.
               However, battery has a whole host of meanings. In addition to beating someone as in "assault and battery," it also refers to a collection of
               artillery or guns: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs collected a battery of weapons; we hope he doesn‚Äôt intend to use them." Beyond guns, a battery can also refer to any
               group or collection of similar things: ‚ÄúShe was subjected to a battery of tests, designed to determine whether she was a genius or just plain
               smart.‚Äù[0m
