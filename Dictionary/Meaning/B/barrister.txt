[91m        SHORT  The Brits and Canadians prefer to say barrister instead of "lawyer," but they mean the same thing. A barrister is a person who goes to court on behalf of the
               defense or the prosecution.[0m
[36m         LONG  The image of the barrister ‚Äî a lawyer who pleads cases in the higher, or what is called "superior," courts of Britain ‚Äî is of a white-wigged gentleman wearing
               a long black gown over a dark suit. Now, everyone who is a barrister wears white wigs. Barristers are so named because they were literally
               "called to the bar," which means that they are able to practice law. Barristers are not the same as solicitors, who advise clients but only
               appear in Britain's lower courts.[0m
