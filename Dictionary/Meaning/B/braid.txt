[36m         LONG  Have you ever seen someone with their hair bound together in thick, rope-like arrangements? That hairdo is called braids. Women often braid each other's hair
               or get it braided by a hairdresser. The longer your hair, the longer your potential braids. To braid hair, you have to weave the strands of
               hair together: this is also called plaiting, lacing, and interlacing. Other materials can be braided, but the most popular thing to braid is
               definitely hair.[0m
