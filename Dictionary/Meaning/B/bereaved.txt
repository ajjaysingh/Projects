[91m        SHORT  Bereaved is an adjective describing people in deep sorrow at the loss of a loved one. For some, being bereaved helps them leave the sadness or release
               themselves from it by experiencing it for awhile.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the Old English berēafian, meaning "deprive of," bereaved describes the loss you feel when someone you love dies. You are suddenly deprived of the
               person's presence, and missing and mourning leads to being bereaved. Losing a pet causes similar feelings, and you can be bereaved when a
               person goes away but is still alive. Loss and separation even in life are still reason to be bereaved over the absence. If someone leaves and
               you miss them deeply, you may be bereaved.[0m
