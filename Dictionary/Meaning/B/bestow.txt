[91m        SHORT  When you present an honor or gift to someone, you bestow it, which is the same as giving it, but often classier and more respectful.[0m
[36m         LONG  Bestow comes from the Middle English stowen, "to place." Placing something really valuable or honoring in the hands of another, or conferring a position of
               responsibility on them, is to bestow it. For example, "She gave her teacher a ceramic apple she had made, knowing that her whole class would
               bestow the big honor of Teacher of the Year later that day," or, "The king praised her for working with the poor, and he would later bestow the
               medal of honor on her in a ceremony."[0m
