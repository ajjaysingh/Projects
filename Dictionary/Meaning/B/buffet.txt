[91m        SHORT  When you see the word buffet, it's hard not to think "all-you-can-eat."  Although the noun can refer to food set out for self-service, buffet also means "a
               blow, especially with the hand," and as a verb "to strike sharply."[0m
[36m         LONG  The two meanings of buffet come from very different sources. Buffet the self-serve meal is drawn from the piece of furniture on which such a meal might be
               served, a bufet "sideboard" in eighteenth-century French, and is pronounced buh-FAY. The meaning of hitting, however, comes from the Old French
               word bufe "a blow" or "a puff of wind" and is spoken BUH-fit.  If the wind buffets the windows of your house, it can make them rattle in their
               frames, and if you are buffeted by bad news, you might shake in your shoes too.[0m
