[91m        SHORT  To bequeath is to leave your possessions to another person after you die. A man might love his classic cars but would be happy to bequeath them to his
               grandchildren when he writes out his last will and testament.[0m
[36m         LONG  Bequeath often is used about making plans to give away property and possessions after a person's death: "It was strange to leave a house to a one-year-old
               baby, but he planned what he would bequeath in his will while he was young, and the baby would be 23 when he finally did die." Sometimes
               bequeath is used for things handed down without death, as when living parents and grandparents pass, or bequeath, a legacy of stories or family
               traits and talents as an inheritance.[0m
