[91m        SHORT  A borough is a town that has its own government. It also can be a part of a big city that has powers of self-government. Manhattan is just one of the five
               boroughs that make up New York City.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a borough is part of a big city, it represents a more formal division than just a neighborhood. It‚Äôs a separate town, often one that has its own
               government. When you move from one borough to another, you might notice different tax rates or different parking regulations. In England the
               word often refers to a town that has a representative in Parliament. Pronounce the second syllable in borough with a long ‚Äúo‚Äù sound, like the
               donkey (burro).[0m
