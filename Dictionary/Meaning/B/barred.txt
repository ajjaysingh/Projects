[36m         LONG  To be barred is to be blocked from entrance or not allowed to do something ‚Äî as if there were imaginary bars in your path. The adjective barred comes from the
               noun bar, and it's easy to remember if you picture the classic barred cell where inmates are confined. Barred can also describe something that
               is marked with bars, like a barred owl.[0m
