[91m        SHORT  Baloney is nonsense. When someone says something completely ridiculous, call it a bunch of baloney. If your friend tells you a unicorn on roller skates ate
               the last cookie, tell her she‚Äôs full of baloney![0m
[36m         LONG  The word baloney comes from the sandwich meat called bologna, which is typically made of leftover scraps of meat. Around 1920, baloney came to mean
               "nonsense," and it was also used to describe an unskilled boxer. Use it to describe utter nonsense, not necessarily evil lies, but just words
               that mean nothing. A politician who spouts clich√©s but really says nothing is full of baloney, and so is a pretentious artist or a pompous
               showoff.[0m
