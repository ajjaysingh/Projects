[91m        SHORT  A benediction is a blessing — either a formal one that you might hear in a church service or an informal one that you might utter when you take any leap of
               faith.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun benediction comes from the Latin roots bene, meaning "well" and diction meaning "to speak" — literally to speak well of. Although it is most often
               used in the religious sense of prayer and blessing — especially a ceremonial prayer at the end of a church service — it can mean any expression
               of good wishes. "Good luck on the test!" the mother cried in benediction as her son set off for school.[0m
