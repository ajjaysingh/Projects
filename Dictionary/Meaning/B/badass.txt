[91m        SHORT  If something starts out serious and then turns trivial, that‚Äôs bathos. If you‚Äôre watching a serious drama about Poland‚Äôs transition to capitalism and it
               suddenly ends in a giddy car chase, you might remark on the film‚Äôs unexpected bathos.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word bathos came into English in the 17th century from the Greek word bathos, which literally means ‚Äúdepth.‚Äù In the 18th century English poet Alexander
               Pope gave the word its current meaning of a descent from lofty to trite. We often use it for movies or books. Bathos is usually unintentional ‚Äî
               which means you can laugh at it. Bathos can also be used more broadly for something that‚Äôs trite or overly sentimental.[0m
