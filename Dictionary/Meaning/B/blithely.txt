[91m        SHORT  The adverb blithely describes something you do in a casually cheerful, somewhat neglectful way, like when you blithely ride your bike down the street, not
               even thinking about all the homework you have to do.[0m
[36m         LONG  Something that's done blithely is careless, like a group of kids blithely dashing off across a frozen pond on their ice skates, forgetting about their slower
               friend. You could talk blithely about your brand new laptop, forgetting that your friend can't afford a new computer. Blithely also means
               "happily," without implying that anything is being overlooked or ignored, like a winning team blithely celebrating their victory.[0m
