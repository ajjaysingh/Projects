[36m         LONG  French Independence Day, or Bastille Day (July 14), commemorates the storming in 1789 of the French king's prison/fort, the Bastille. Bastion and Bastille
               share the root bast, which means "build." Bastion can refer to any place to which one turns for safety; that can include not only buildings but
               also concepts, ideas, and even beliefs. The Church, for example, is a bastion of many religious beliefs.[0m
