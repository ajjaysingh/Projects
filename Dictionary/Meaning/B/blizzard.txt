[91m        SHORT  A blizzard is a large winter storm, characterized by heavy snowfall and accompanied by high winds. We're not talking flurry or a snowsquall. It's the kind of
               snow storm you read about.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you had to shovel 5 inches of snow off of your sidewalk, the snow storm was probably just a snow storm, an annoyance perhaps but not a blizzard. A blizzard
               is a huge snowstorm that results in the disruption of normal activities. Offices close, schools are shut down, streets are snow-packed, and
               people stay at home. The word can also be used figuratively, to mean "a rash" of something тАФ like the blizzard of insurance forms you had to
               complete after surgery.[0m
