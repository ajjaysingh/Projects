  SHORT        If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races, or religions, we call that person a bigot. The intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry
               is ugly.
  LONG         There are different types of bigotry — like religious bigotry or racist bigotry. Although bigotry can mean any form of intolerance or prejudice, when the word
               is used alone, it is most often understood to mean racial bigotry. The bigotry behind Jim Crow laws that separated races in the 1950s seems
               unbelievable to most modern teenagers.

     >         Subsequent generations followed the lead of the Founding Era’s leaders: They tolerated bigotry and prejudicial policies in order to promote white prosperity
               and security.
     >         We must make it clear that there is no room in our tent for despicable bigotries like racism, misogyny or anti-Semitism.
