[91m        SHORT  A bugle is a very simple brass instrument. Bugles are commonly used in the military to mark parts of the day, including first thing in the morning.[0m
[36m         LONG  Bugles are notable for their lack of valves ‚Äî instead of controlling pitch with the fingers, a bugler does it entirely with her lips on the mouthpiece. The
               traditional bugle call is the series of notes used in military camps to signal daybreak and dusk, and sometimes other daily routines. Bugle was
               originally an Old French word meaning "musical horn," but also "wild ox" or "buffalo." The "horn" meaning came from the curled shape of an
               animal's horn.[0m
