[91m        SHORT  As an adjective, bucolic refers to an ideal country life that many yearn for. If your parents wanted to raise you in a bucolic environment, you may find
               yourself living 45 minutes away from the nearest movie theater or person your age. Not ideal.[0m
[36m         LONG  You wouldn‚Äôt know it to look at it, but bucolic is a distant relation of cow, and all bucolic‚Äôs meanings can be connected to the bovine creature. Bucolic
               ultimately comes from the Greek boukolos, cowherd or herdsman. A bucolic could be a short poem about pastoral (cow) life or a country person,
               who is stereotyped as a cowherd. Used as an adjective, bucolic can refer to an idealized rural life (think life with cows) or to herdsmen (more
               cows). And that‚Äôs no bull.[0m
