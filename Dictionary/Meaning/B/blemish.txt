[91m        SHORT  A blemish is a small flaw. If you borrow your brother's brand new bicycle, you'd better be careful ‚Äî what might seem like the tiniest blemish to you might be
               a horribly ruined paint job to him.[0m
[36m         LONG  The classic example of a blemish is a pimple or other mark on your skin, but you can call any small defect a blemish ‚Äî like a worm hole in an apple or a
               scrape on the side of your car. A flaw or fault in your personality or morals can also be called a blemish. You might say that the one time
               your dog accidentally nipped you is the only blemish on his reputation as a sweet, gentle pet.[0m
