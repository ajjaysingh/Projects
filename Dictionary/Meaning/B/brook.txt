[91m        SHORT  A brook is a small stream. On a hot day, you might enjoy wading in a babbling brook. As a verb, brook is a rather stuffy word for "put up with." The lord of
               the manor might say, "I will brook no trespassing on my land."[0m
[36m         LONG  Brook is tailor-made for talking about what you won't stand for‚Äîit's always "brook no..." If you brook no criticism of your friend, it means you won't let
               people speak ill of her. If you brook no brooks, it means you've developed a bizarre stream-hating fetish and will spend the rest of your days
               trying to stop their flow.[0m
