[36m         LONG  Belligerence in people is characterized by a tendency to pick fights or be aggressive toward others. It can be something in your nature, if you're, say, a
               bully, or it can be an attitude you summon in the heat of battle, as when you're going up against a rival sports team. One thing's for sure,
               though, there is nothing peaceful about belligerence, which, when displayed by armies or countries, can lead to devastating wars.[0m
