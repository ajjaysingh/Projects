[91m        SHORT  To beckon is to use a physical gesture to call someone over to you. Universally recognized gestures used to beckon include crooking the finger or nodding the
               head to  invite someone over.[0m
[36m         LONG  We get the word beckon from the Old English gebecnian, meaning "to make a mute sign," which comes from bƒìacen, meaning "a sign or beacon."  (Remember that
               "beacon" is a noun while  beckon is a verb).  When you beckon to someone, you give them a physical sign to "come here."  Figuratively, an ice
               cream sundae might beckon you, calling you away from your diet.[0m
