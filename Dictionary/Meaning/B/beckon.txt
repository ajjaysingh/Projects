                                                                                      BECKON                                                                                      
  SHORT        To beckon is to use a physical gesture to call someone over to you. Universally recognized gestures used to beckon include crooking the finger or nodding the
               head to  invite someone over.
  LONG         We get the word beckon from the Old English gebecnian, meaning "to make a mute sign," which comes from bēacen, meaning "a sign or beacon."  (Remember that
               "beacon" is a noun while  beckon is a verb).  When you beckon to someone, you give them a physical sign to "come here."  Figuratively, an ice
               cream sundae might beckon you, calling you away from your diet.
