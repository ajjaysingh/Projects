[91m        SHORT  Every school, museum, and struggling artist is in search for a generous benefactor, or someone to provide the financial means to keep everything running
               smoothly.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin roots of benefactor are bene, which means "well," and facere, which means "to do" ‚Äî literally, "to do well."  A benefactor does well by supporting
               (usually financially) a person or a good cause. In the old days, a struggling artist or actor might have been supported by a wealthy
               benefactor. Now, many struggling artists and actors have to rely on waiting tables and other odd jobs instead.[0m
