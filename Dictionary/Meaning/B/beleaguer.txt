[91m        SHORT  Beleaguer means to pester or badger with persistence. A babysitter might find annoying the children who beleaguer her with requests for candy, cookies, games,
               and piggyback rides all at the same time.[0m
[36m         LONG  Beleaguer originally meant to lay siege to, and originates from a 16th century Dutch term which meant to camp all around. It was not until later that
               beleaguer came to mean harass or bother in a determined way. Remember that there is a league in the middle of be-league-r and the spelling will
               be easy.[0m
