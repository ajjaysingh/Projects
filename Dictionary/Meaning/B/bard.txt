[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôve heard the word bard, it was probably in English class. William Shakespeare has been known as "The Bard" since the nineteenth century, but the word
               has a much older history, and, when it's not capitalized, it simply means "lyric poet."[0m
[36m         LONG  In civilizations without written histories, poets and singers were the ones to spread the word from place to place and across generations. In ancient and
               medieval Gaelic societies, the professional storytellers were called bards (or bardds, in Wales). Irish bards were part of a chieftain's
               household, and their job was to record and proclaim the exploits of their lord ‚Äî although a bard might also compose blistering satires if he
               was displeased with his employer.[0m
