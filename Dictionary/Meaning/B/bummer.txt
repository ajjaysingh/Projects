[91m        SHORT  A bummer is a huge disappointment. It's a bummer when you try out for a big role in a play and don't end up getting it.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word bummer is a very casual way to describe or make note of a frustrating experience. You can say, "It was such a bummer when we missed the train," or
               respond to bad news by saying, "Bummer!" The current meaning is from 1960s slang, but in the 1880s a bummer was a "loafer" or "idle person,"
               probably from the German slang word bummler, "loafer."[0m
