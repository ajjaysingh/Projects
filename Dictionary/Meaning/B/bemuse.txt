[91m        SHORT  To bemuse is to confuse or puzzle. You could bemuse your teacher by writing an essay as a series of haikus, but don‚Äôt. Usually a bemused teacher is not a
               happy one.[0m
[36m         LONG  Bemuse is not the same as amuse, which means to entertain someone or make them laugh. If you tell a joke, you don‚Äôt want to bemuse your audience because they
               won‚Äôt laugh, they‚Äôll be too busy trying figure out what you just said. New situations and weird dreams bemuse some people, so they feel dazed
               and bemused.[0m
