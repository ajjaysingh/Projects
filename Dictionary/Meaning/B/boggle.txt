[36m         LONG  You'll most likely find this verb in sentences like "My brain boggles at the outfit she decided to wear to the party," or "When you watch this movie, your
               mind will boggle at the special effects." Along with the even more common adjective mind-boggling, boggle comes from the Middle English bugge,
               or "specter." Boggle originally meant "spook," or "start with fright."[0m
