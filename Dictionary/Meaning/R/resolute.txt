  LONG         "Milo thought for just a moment and then, with a resolute 'I shall,' volunteered to go," Norton Juster writes in the classic children's novel The Phantom
               Tollbooth. From the way Milo said "I shall," we can infer that he was quite confident in his split-second decision, or at least made himself

               something, you're declaring you don't like it and never will.
