  SHORT        A rampage is when a group of people is destructive and out of control, like an angry, violent riot following an unpopular political decision.
  LONG         A single individual can go on a rampage, wreaking havoc and destruction, but the word most often describes the actions of an angry mob. You can also use
               rampage as a verb, as when furious football fans rampage through a town overturning cars and setting things on fire. The word was originally
               Scottish, from the Middle English ramp, "rave or rush wildly about."
