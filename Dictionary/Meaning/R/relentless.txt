[91m        SHORT  Relentless is a good word for describing something that's harsh, unforgiving, and persistent, like the hot sun in the desert, or a cold that keeps you in bed

[36m         LONG  When you're relentless about something, you mean business. You're not stopping until you get what you want, and you're not taking "no" for an answer. People
               might try to steer you from your goal, but you have eyes only for the prize and they're just going to have to get out of your way. If you're a
               relentless student, for instance, you might stay up all night studying your vocabulary, just in case there might be a quiz in the morning.[0m
