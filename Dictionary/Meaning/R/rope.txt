[36m         LONG  Ropes are handy on sailboats for tying up sails; you also use ropes for mountain climbing, lassoing a steer, raising a curtain on a theater stage, and doing
               aerial tricks in the circus. As a verb, rope means "catch with a rope," or colloquially, to convince someone to do something: "She'll try to
               rope me into helping with the bake sale." When you show someone "the ropes," you explain the way things are done.[0m
