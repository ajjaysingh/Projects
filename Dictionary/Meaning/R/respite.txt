[91m        SHORT  A respite is a break from something that's difficult or unpleasant. If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a respite from the
               intensity.[0m
[36m         LONG  Respite may look like it rhymes with despite, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-pit).  It comes from the Latin word respectus, meaning
               refuge, but we almost always use respite to describe a time, not a place, of relief. If you've been fighting with your partner, a visit from a
               friend might offer a brief respite from the argument, but the fight will pick up again when she leaves.[0m
