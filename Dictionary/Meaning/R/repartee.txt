[91m        SHORT  Late night talk show hosts are known for being experts at repartee, or clever conversation, with their celebrity guests.[0m
[36m         LONG  Repartee comes from the French word repartire which is a fencing term meaning an answering thrust with a sword. When you are engaging in repartee, you don't
               literally stab someone, but you come back with a quick sharp blow. Most of us aren't as quick as we'd like to be. Mark Twain defined repartee
               as, "something we think of 24 hours too late."[0m

[3m             > The colorfully contrasted characters are still abundant, but the repartee is, for the most part, content to be merely snappy, not socially insightful.[0m
