[91m        SHORT  Truly, your resilience, or ability to bounce back, is not just admirable, but foolhardy, some might say; who else could have survived an attack by a rabid
               toucan and then gone on to become a world-renowned bird breeder?[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun resilience stems from the Latin resiliens “to rebound, recoil.” As a character trait, resilience is a person’s ability to recover quickly from
               unfortunate circumstances or illness. Runners who fall during a marathon only to pop back up and dash through the finish line show some serious
               resilience. Or Silly Putty that can stretch and stretch without breaking, and then come back to rest inside its egg-shaped carrying case —
               that’s resilience, or elasticity, for you.[0m
