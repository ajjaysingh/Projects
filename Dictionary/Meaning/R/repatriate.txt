  SHORT        When a country repatriates people, they are usually refugees who are being sent back to their homeland, often against their wishes.
  LONG         It is possible for a person to repatriate himself, choosing to return to a country he's left for political or economic reasons, but the verb repatriate is
               more often used to mean "send refugees home." It might sound like a modern political term, but repatriate has been used since the 1600s. It
               comes from the Latin word repatriare, "return to one's own country," from the prefix re, "back," and patria, "native land."
