  SHORT        A red herring in crime fiction is the conspicuous clue or suspicious character simply there to mislead you from working out the real villain. Butlers are
               usually red herrings.
  LONG         The sense of red herring as something deliberately distracting actually comes from the literal sense of red herring — as in the fish — which when smoked turns
               red. Such red herrings (also known as kippers,) were used to create trails for hounds when teaching them how to follow a trail of scent.
