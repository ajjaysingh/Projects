[91m        SHORT  To rue is to feel regret or remorse for something. If that position at the deli ended up involving a reality TV show that made everyone famous, you may rue
               the day you turned down the job.[0m
[36m         LONG  Rue comes from the Old English word hreowan, meaning "to make sorry," and rue can still sum up a lot of sorrow in one small syllable. Rue is a modern verb
               that often looks back on the past. Shakespeare made famous the phrase "rue the day," meaning you bitterly regret a moment. For example, you
               might rue the day you had your first coffee if you become hopelessly addicted to it.[0m
