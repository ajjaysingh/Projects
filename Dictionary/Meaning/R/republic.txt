                                               REPUBLIC                                               
  SHORT        If you live in a republic, then you live in a country with a leader freely and
               democratically elected by the people, as opposed to a dictatorship
               or monarchy.
  LONG         Ancient Rome, before it started declining and falling all over the place, was a
               republic, and so is the United States. Republics have what are
               termed "republican" forms of government — not to be confused with
               Republican-with-a-big-R, as in the American political party. If you
               live in a "Banana Republic" you probably live in a tiny Caribbean
               island run by a dictator. Or you're spending too much time at the
               mall.
