[91m        SHORT  Repatriation is the act of returning to your own country. If you’ve been living in another country since you were two, and you are now thirty-five,
               repatriation may be more complicated.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Latin, the prefix re- signifies a return of some kind, and patria is another way of saying a person's native land. Repatriation generally refers to a
               person who has either forcibly or voluntarily left his own country and is now returning. It can also refer to the return of important objects,
               like historical artifacts, to their country of origin. If you're a patriotic person, then repatriation is important to you, especially for
               significant people or objects![0m
