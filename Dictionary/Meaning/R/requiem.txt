[91m        SHORT  A requiem is a religious ceremony performed for the dead. A requiem, or dirge, can also be a piece of music used for this ceremony or in any other context
               honoring those who have died.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word requiem comes from the opening words of the Roman Catholic Mass for the Dead, which is spoken or sung in Latin (requies means ‚Äúrest‚Äù). In a
               nonreligious context the word refers simply to an act of remembrance. Mozart, Brahms, and Dvo≈ô√°k have all written important requiems. The
               English composer Benjamin Britten wrote his famous "War Requiem" for the reconsecration of a cathedral that was destroyed in World War II.[0m
