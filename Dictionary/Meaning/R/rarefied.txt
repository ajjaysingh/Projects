[36m         LONG  To correctly pronounce rarefied, accent the first syllable: "RARE-uh-fied." In addition to high-minded conversation, the word rarefied can also describe the
               air in high elevations that has less oxygen, like the rarefied air that can be challenging to mountain climbers. Sometimes the quality of
               airlessness shades the other meaning of the word, implying that the rarefied world of elegant people isn't comfortable to everyone.[0m
