[91m        SHORT  A recreant is a heavy-duty coward. If your friend shoves you in front of him when a growling dog approaches, you'd quickly recognize him for the recreant that
               he is. And in the future you‚Äôd choose your friends more carefully.[0m
[36m         LONG  An extreme recreant would be the soldier who goes over to the enemy if it looks like they might win. Definitely not the kind of person you'd want in your
               platoon. Recreant (RE-cree-unt) comes from the Latin re-, meaning to "reverse" something, and credere, "entrust." The word miscreant is nearly
               synonymous, although a miscreant is not so much a coward, but just an all-around bad sort.[0m
