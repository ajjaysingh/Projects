[91m        SHORT  A repercussion is something that happens because of another action. You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your apartment might be the

[36m         LONG  Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion ‚Äî what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum) getting hit. With
               repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that original strike over and over
               as it reverberates through the air.[0m
