[36m         LONG  The noun rehabilitation comes from the Latin prefix re-, meaning “again” and habitare, meaning “make fit.” When something falls in to disrepair and needs to
               be restored to a better condition, it needs rehabilitation. People seek rehabilitation after an accident or surgery to restore their strength,
               or to learn to live without drugs or other addictive substances or behaviors.[0m
