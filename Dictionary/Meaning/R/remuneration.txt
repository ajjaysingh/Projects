  SHORT        When you politely refuse your neighbor’s offer of remuneration for your efforts with the lawn, you may have made a mistake. Remuneration refers to payment for
               a service, so the neighbor was basically offering you cash.
  LONG         If it makes you uncomfortable to talk about your wages, you can use the word remuneration instead — the word has a remote sound to it that makes it seem like
               you aren’t talking about money even though you are. It’s a formal way to refer to payment for work or other services. You might see this word
               in contracts, policies, and other official documents that refer to payments.

     >         Yet, the remuneration for the athletes who make it all possible through sweat and blood has increased incrementally, at best, rather than commensurately.

     >         Their mosques seek practical solutions; whether that is foreign financing, or unsophisticated clerics from their homelands who will accept modest
               remuneration.
     >         The code specifically addresses remuneration: “No financial rewards or substantive gifts are offered for patient referrals.”
