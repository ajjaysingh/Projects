[91m        SHORT  A rung is one of the horizontal steps of a ladder. You should never stand on the very top rung of a ladder ‚Äî it can be dangerous![0m
[36m         LONG  From the literal ladder definition of rung, a place to put your foot (or hand) as you climb up, comes the metaphorical meaning of "a level." For example, if
               you get a promotion at work, you might say you're climbing up the rungs of the company. The horizontal bars between the legs of a chair are
               also rungs. This word comes from a Germanic root meaning "stake, staff, or bar."[0m
