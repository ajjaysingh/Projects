[91m        SHORT  When someone calls out "rise and shine," they are trying to rouse you, to make you wake up.[0m
[36m         LONG  It's thought that the word rouse was originally a 15th-century term used by hawkers for the way the birds shook out their feathers when agitated. That gives a
               nice mental picture to the word, and it does fit: rouse means to become awake, excited, or just plain keyed up, like those birds ruffling their
               feathers. Consider that when first roused in the morning, many people have to shake themselves to get ready to face the day.[0m
