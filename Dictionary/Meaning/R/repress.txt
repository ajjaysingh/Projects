[91m        SHORT  Whether you're repressing a feeling, an idea or even a revolution you're almost always going to be taking advantage of the press in repress. To repress
               something is to "press it down" where it can't be seen, heard or even recognized.[0m
[36m         LONG  Psychologists often try to help people recover memories that they've repressed so that they can feel free of them once and for all. What makes repress
               different from press is that repress is almost always used when you're talking about an idea, concept or something intangible. In other words,
               you repress, say, your emotions. You don't repress olives to get olive oil. However, you can repress someone or some group by intimidating them
               — like repressing the protesters by sending out cops on horseback.[0m
