[91m        SHORT  Repugnance means strong distaste for something. If you love animals, you probably feel repugnance for people who mistreat their horses.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word repugnance comes from Latin root words, re, meaning back, and pugnare,  to fight. When we use repugnance, we don't just mean the feeling of fighting
               back or resisting, but also a feeling of horror or sickness that causes you to resist in the first place. If something grosses you out, you
               feel repugnance for it. Repugnance can also express a feeling of moral horror: you probably feel repugnance at photographs of torture.[0m
