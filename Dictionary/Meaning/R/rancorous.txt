[91m        SHORT  The adjective rancorous comes in handy when you're describing someone's bitter grudge, like the attitude of your cousin who still won't speak to you after the
               April Fool's Day prank you played four years ago.[0m
[36m         LONG  A story can be rancorous, if it's full of resentment, and so can an argument, if it's particularly bitter and angry. The word rancorous can be traced back to
               the Latin word rancere, which means "to stink." This in turn led to rancorem, "bitterness or rancidness." When you speak to your arch enemy and
               your words are so angry and bitter that they almost stink, go ahead and describe them as rancorous.[0m
