[91m        SHORT  If you give a loud shout in a cavernous place, like a gym or a church, the sound of your voice will reverberate throughout the room. Reverberate means sound
               waves traveling back and forth, as in an echo.[0m
[36m         LONG  Often we use reverberate to talk about sound, or sometimes light. If a noise echoes for a long time, we can say the space reverberates with that noise. You
               may have heard of a reverb effect in audio processing, which is basically a long echo. We also use the word metaphorically to describe the
               impact of huge events. For example, the 2008 mortgage crisis in the US reverberated throughout the world’s economy, causing a global recession.[0m
