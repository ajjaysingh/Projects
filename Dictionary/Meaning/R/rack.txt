[91m        SHORT  A rack is a device meant to hold something, or several things. A coat rack has hooks for hanging coats, and a magazine rack has shelves or slots to hold
               magazines.[0m
[36m         LONG  In a store, racks hold and display items for sale (like clothes racks and book racks), while in your house you have racks for storing things (a spice rack),
               or drying them (in the case of a towel rack). If you rack, or wrack, your brain, it means you think extra hard;and when something goes "to rack
               and ruin," it becomes old and decrepit, or falls apart.[0m
