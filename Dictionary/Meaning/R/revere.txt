[91m        SHORT  Revere means that to respect someone so deeply that you almost worship them. Despite the size of the American military, the American people revere peacemakers
               like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. Rock stars are revered by throngs of devoted fans.[0m
[36m         LONG  Revere is related to the words reverence ("to hold something in worshipful awe") and its opposite â€” irreverent. Reverence for the irreverent is actually
               possible. Howard Stern humor is often vulgar and absurdly irreverent yet his legions of fans and even some media analysts revere him and his
               ability to maintain a loyal audience. Revere is the perfect word when respect is not strong enough but worship seems a little too religious-
               sounding.[0m
