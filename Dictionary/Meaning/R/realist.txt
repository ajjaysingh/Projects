[91m        SHORT  Some may say you never expect good things to happen, but maybe you‚Äôre just a realist, a person who uses facts and past events, rather than hopeful feelings
               and wishes, to predict the future.[0m
[36m         LONG  In art, Realist painters started a movement by depicting the world around them as it actually appeared, rather than painting flattering portraits of
               unattractive people and scenes too good to be true. You don't have to be an artist to be a realist ‚Äî just consider limitations and anticipate
               that things that can go wrong will go wrong. The downside? Realists don't get to dream of the great things that could happen if everything goes
               right.[0m
