[91m        SHORT  If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly honest assessment of your friend's new haircut.[0m
[36m         LONG  Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning "back," and the verb cantare, meaning "to sing." It has been suggested that recant was first used
               when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is
               true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant ‚Äî unless you've been casting nasty spells on people.[0m
