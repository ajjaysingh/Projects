[91m        SHORT  A recapitulation is a short summary. At the end of an hour-long speech, you should probably give a recapitulation if you want your audience to remember
               anything you‚Äôve just said.[0m
[36m         LONG  A recapitulation, or "recap," is a summary, review, or restatement. The purpose of a recapitulation is to remind your reader or audience of your main points.
               There's no new information in a recapitulation, just the same information in a smaller, more condensed form. The prefix re- is a signal that a
               recapitulation involves repeating something.[0m
