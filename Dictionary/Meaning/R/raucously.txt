	Wiki Definition:
              	Raucous  means unpleasantly loud, or behaving in a noisy and disorderly way. It can be hard to give an oral report in the front of a classroom when the kids
               in the back are being  raucous .  Raucous  is often used to refer to loud laughter, loud voices, or a loud party, all of which can be harsh or
               unpleasant.
