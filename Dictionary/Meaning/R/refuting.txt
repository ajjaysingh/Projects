                                                                                     REFUTING                                                                                     
  SHORT        The verb refute is to prove that something is wrong. When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can refute their claim by presenting
               the dry toothbrushes.
  LONG         Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that
               refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. Refute comes from the Latin refutare for "to check, suppress." A near synonym is confute, but save
               refute as an everyday word for proving something is false.
