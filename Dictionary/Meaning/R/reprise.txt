[91m        SHORT  Reprise means "repeat an earlier role." If you‚Äôre asked to reprise your role as "kid entertainer" at the annual family reunion, that means people want you to
               do it again this year.[0m
[36m         LONG  Early on, reprise was a part in a song or other musical composition that is repeated. The word still carries that meaning, but now it's more likely to be used
               as a verb to describe an action or part that is repeated, often a performance. For example, if you played a role in a wildly successful film
               that is going to have a sequel, you would reprise your role. The word comes from the French word repris, meaning "take back."[0m
