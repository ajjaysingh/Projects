[91m        SHORT  If something is romantic, it isn't very practical, like the librarian's romantic dream of convincing every person in town to read a book a week for life — a
               great idea that probably isn't possible.[0m
[36m         LONG  To be romantic about something can mean that you overlook its flaws and shortcomings. If your romantic ideal is growing all of your own food on a secluded
               farm, you are probably ignoring the tremendous amount of hard work it will require. Or, if you are romantic about love, you believe the perfect
               person is out there and in finding one another, all the problems and difficulties of life will melt away.[0m
