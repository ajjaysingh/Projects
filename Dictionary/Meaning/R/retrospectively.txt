[91m        SHORT  Doing something retrospectively means being conscious of what happened previously, or applying something new to past events. When you retrospectively comment

               entire career. If your raise at work applies retrospectively, that means you'll get additional pay from days you worked in the past, as well as
               the future. The Latin root of retrospectively is retrospicere, "look back."[0m
