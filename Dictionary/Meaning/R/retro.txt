[91m        SHORT  Retro things imitate a style from the past. A retro diner might serve 1950s-style milkshakes and be decorated like a diner from that era, but the prices will

[36m         LONG  If you like retro clothes, you probably shop online and at thrift shops, where you can find pants from the 70s and prom dresses from the 50s. Retro music is
               heavily influenced by past genres, like rockabilly or doo-wop. You can also use retro as a noun: "I'm really into retro when it comes to cars."
               The word was first used in the 1970s in French, r√©tro, short for r√©trograde, from the Latin retrogradi, "move backward."[0m
