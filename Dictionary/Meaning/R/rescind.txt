[36m         LONG  Things that are rescinded: policies, court decisions, regulations, and official statements. What all these examples have in common is that they are on the
               record. Also, rescind usually refers to promises instead of tangible objects. You can't rescind a shirt a friend has borrowed from you, but you
               can rescind your offer to loan them your jeans.[0m
