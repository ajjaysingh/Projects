                                                                                     REPLETE                                                                                      
  SHORT        Replete means full, often in a satisfying way. "The library was replete with bound first editions, and Lucy, a bookworm, was happier there than any place
               else."
  LONG         Replete shares a root with the word plenty. When you have plenty of cookies and cake, you can say your table is replete with goodies. Another cousin of
               replete is replenish. When your cabinets are bare, you go to the store to replenish them. When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is
               replete with essentials.

     >         Puns abound, and verbal stunts like having the tribe on a remote island speak a language replete with pasta names – cannoli, linguine, and manicotti.
     >         Military history is replete with examples of armies that, having won one kind of conflict, find themselves unready for something different.
     >         The two pilots’ writing style is different – Smith’s, iconoclastic and witty, Vanhoenacker’s, poetic, philosophical, erudite – and replete with Herman
               Melville references.
