      Origin:  Old English ( ge)recenian ‚Äòrecount, relate‚Äô, of West Germanic origin; related to Dutch rekenen and German rechnen ‚Äòto count (up)‚Äô. Early senses included ‚Äògive
               an account of items received‚Äô and ‚Äòmention things in order‚Äô, which gave rise to the notion of ‚Äòcalculation‚Äô and hence of ‚Äòbeing of an opinion‚Äô.
