[91m        SHORT  Repression is a kind of holding back or holding down. There's repression of feelings (willing yourself not to cry), as well as social repression (where the
               government limits freedom or shuts out certain groups).[0m
[36m         LONG  Repression is like suppression: you restrain, inhibit, or subdue something. Not allowing women to vote is a perfect example of political repression. If you
               have trouble expressing your feelings and keep things bottled up, then emotional repression is a big part of your personality. People often
               turn to repression because they're scared of what will happen if they say what's on their mind. Unfortunately, political and emotional
               repression can often lead to anger and even violence.[0m
