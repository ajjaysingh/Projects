[91m        SHORT  Remission refers to a stage of lesser intensity, when something subsides or improves. Remission is usually a good thing ‚Äî like when your cancer is in
               remission, it means that it is manageable and not getting any worse.[0m
[36m         LONG  Remission comes from the Latin remissionem, meaning "relaxation, a sending back." If something difficult lets up, you'll be able to relax a little. For
               example, if are being pelted non-stop during a dodgeball game, you'd hope for a remission, so you have a minute to take a breath and find your
               glasses. Another meaning of the noun remission is a payment. Your college tuition remission must be taken care of before you start classes.[0m
