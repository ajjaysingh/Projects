[91m        SHORT  When you think about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat,  associate a rout with the agonizing defeat. A rout is the kind of humiliating loss that
               makes you wish you would have been injured in the first quarter so you could have avoided the outcome.[0m
[36m         LONG  One way to remember the meaning of the word rout is to consider its similarity to the word riot, both suggesting a disastrous mess. One interesting thing
               about the word rout is that whether it's used as a noun or as a verb, it's spelled the same and implies a similar meaning. "The losing team
               suffers during a rout while the winning team actually routs them!" Whichever form you use, you're referring to a pretty devastating defeat.[0m

      Origin:  Middle English: ultimately based on Latin ruptus â€˜brokenâ€™, from the verb rumpere ; sense 1 and the verb (late 16th century) are from obsolete French route,
               probably from Italian rotta â€˜break-up of an armyâ€™; the other senses are via Anglo-Norman French rute .
