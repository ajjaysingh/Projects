[91m        SHORT  A rodeo is a type of entertainment that shows off cowboy skills, such as wrestling steers and roping cattle.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the western United States, a popular type of entertainment is an exhibition known as a rodeo. A rodeo is a place where cowboys demonstrate what they can do
               for a crowd. Many of these skills are dangerous, like wrestling a steer or riding a bull. Some skills involve lassos and other uses of rope,
               such as roping (tying up) a goat. These skills are for entertainment at a rodeo, but they're necessary on a cattle ranch.[0m
