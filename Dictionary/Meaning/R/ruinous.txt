[91m        SHORT  Something ruinous is really terrible or devastating, like a ruinous hurricane that floods your house or the ruinous effect of a new law on a country's poorest
               citizens.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective ruinous perfectly describes something so bad that it truly causes ruin, "the destruction or disintegration of something." A house fire can be
               ruinous, and so can a bad hand at a poker table, if the player has bet her last dollar. Ruinous and ruin comes from the Latin root ruina, "a
               collapse, a rushing down, a tumbling down."[0m
