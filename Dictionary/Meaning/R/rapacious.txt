[91m        SHORT  Something rapacious is out to devour ‚Äî anything, and little can stand in its way. A rapacious landlord is out for more rent, and a rapacious eater is only
               satisfied at the all-you-can-eat buffet.[0m
[36m         LONG  A 17th-century word, from the Latin rapere, "to snatch," rapacious originally described the people and animals who often preyed on weaker creatures and
               devoured them, by eating them or by ruining them through some scandal. Modern-day companies even get the label rapacious when their appetites
               for profit seem to devour "lesser" interests, like the environment and employee benefits.[0m
