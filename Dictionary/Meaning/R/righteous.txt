[91m        SHORT  Do you consider yourself a moral person, who tries to do good and be good? If the answer is yes, you are righteous ‚Äî in the right.[0m
[36m         LONG  Being righteous literally means to be right, especially in a moral way. Religious people often talk about being righteous. In their view, the righteous person
               not only does the right thing for other people but also follows the laws of their religion. Heroes like Martin Luther King are often called
               righteous. On the other hand, this word can be a little negative. If you call someone self-righteous, it means they're a little too sure
               they're right and better than other people.[0m
