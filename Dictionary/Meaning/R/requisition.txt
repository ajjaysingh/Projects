[91m        SHORT  Requisition is a very official-sounding word that usually means "to take or seize."  We're sorry that your luxury suite has been requisitioned by the mayor's
               office.  No, we have no idea what he's doing in there.[0m
[36m         LONG  Requisition looks a little like "request" and, in fact, it comes from the Old French word meaning exactly that.  It can still be used that way, like when you
               make a requisition for a new office desk because the old one has three broken drawers.  If a police officer requisitions your car for use in a
               high speed chase, it will initially require less paperwork.[0m
