                                                                                    RESPONDENT                                                                                    
  SHORT        A respondent is a person who gives an answer. For example, on some Monday mornings, your teacher might feel like she is talking to the walls â€” although she
               asks questions, none of the sleepy students are willing respondents.
  LONG         A respondent is a person who answers a question, letter, email message, survey, or anything else that requires a response. You can see the word respond, which
               means "answer or reply to" in respondent. If a poll reveals that bullying is the top concern regarding school safety, you know that many
               respondents checked the box marked "bullying."

     >         Around 6% of respondents selected trolling as their favourite activity.
     >         The survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for newspaper El Universal showed that 74 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of Trump, a Republican.
     >         Most of the studies didn't ask respondents' sexual orientation, but among those that did, most of the participants were straight.
     >         Many respondents said they, too, have lost friends online during this election season, usually over posts that promote opposite stances, but sometimes for
               personal attacks.
     >         A survey by Gallup Korea on Friday showed that 59 percent of 1,007 respondents opposed the agreement between the two countries.
