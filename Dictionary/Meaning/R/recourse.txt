[91m        SHORT  Recourse is a source of help.   If you're failing trigonometry in spite of studying until your brain hurts, you may have no recourse but to hire a tutor.[0m
[36m         LONG  Recourse comes from the Latin word recursus, meaning ‚Äúto run back or retreat.‚Äù People seek recourse from such difficulties as debt, illness and legal woes, so
               you can think of recourse as the words "retreating from curses" squished together.  For the record, though, the cursus in recursus means
               course, not curse. Actually, no one knows where the word curse comes from.  There may be some connection between cursus and curses, but then
               again, there may not be.[0m
