[91m        SHORT  Restitution is the act of making up for damages or harm. Remember the time you knocked the ball out of the park, scoring a home run but breaking a house's
               window in the process? You had to make restitution for the broken window, paying for its replacement.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun restitution means both "restoring something to its original state" and "returning something to its rightful owner," like a public apology that leads
               to the restitution of a person's honor and reputation.  Restitution also has a specific legal meaning ‚Äî an order given by a judge to a
               convicted criminal to make amends for the crime. For examples, judges often order people to pay restitution for the damage they cause.[0m
