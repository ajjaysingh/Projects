                                                                                    RHETORICAL                                                                                    
  SHORT        If you ask a rhetorical question it means you don’t necessarily expect an answer, but you do want an occasion to talk about something.
  LONG         Rhetoric is the art of written or spoken communication. If you went to school a hundred years ago, your English class would have been called Rhetoric. But
               nowadays if we say something is rhetorical, we usually mean that it’s only good for talking. If you speak beautifully about carpentry but can’t
               ever actually build a cabinet, we might say you have lots of rhetorical flare, but very little real skill.
                                                                            EXAMPLES FROM VOCABULARY:                                                                             
     >         This approach would have real value today, not just because of its rhetorical niceties but because it connects to a concrete policy agenda.
     >         This is a rhetorical question, but I just want readers to understand this, very clearly.
     >         Priebus seemed to be trying to thread the same constitutional and rhetorical needle.
     >         Trump’s rhetorical volleys against trade drew surprisingly little comment, given that the UAE is a symbol of globalization.
     >         Mr. Trump’s lack of public policy experience and his frequent rhetorical flip-flops, the second reason deserves only partial credit.
