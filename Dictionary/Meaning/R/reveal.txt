  SHORT        When you make something visible or make it public information, you reveal it. For example, if you want to plan a picnic, wait until forecasters reveal the
               weather that is predicted.
  LONG         The verb reveal comes from the Latin word revelare meaning "unveil," like when you take off your hat to reveal your new haircut, or when you reveal
               information about your past that will shock or amuse your friends. You might also be familiar with the noun form of reveal, makeover show-speak
               for the moment viewers see the newly renovated room or someone's dramatic new look, as in saving the reveal for the end of the show so people
               keep watching.
