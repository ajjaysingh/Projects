[91m        SHORT  In a monarchy, if the king gets too sick to rule his country, a regent steps in to run things temporarily.[0m
[36m         LONG  When kings or queens aren't able to do their jobs ‚Äî because they're ill, or often because they are children ‚Äî trusted advisers called regents fill in. You can
               think of a regent as a substitute monarch. There's also a more permanent kind of regent who helps to run a business or university and can also
               be called a trustee or board member. In Latin, regent means "ruling," from the verb regere, "to rule."[0m
