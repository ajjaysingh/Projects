[36m         LONG  Near synonyms are blameworthy and culpable. Antonyms are blameless and praiseworthy. The adjective reprehensible is from Middle English, from Latin
               reprehensus, from reprehendere plus the suffix -ibilis "deserving of, capable of." If someone is reprehended, they are blamed or strongly
               criticized.[0m
