[36m         LONG  Though this word most commonly appears as a noun in the phrase "in retrospect," it can also be used as a verb. The prefix retro- means ‚Äúback," and spect is a
               component of the words inspect, spectator, spectacles, and perspective, among others, which all have to do with looking or seeing. So it makes
               sense that retrospect means to look back in time, or to remember.[0m
