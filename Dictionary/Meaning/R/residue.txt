[36m         LONG  When residue refers to a liquid, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs left at the bottom of a bottle, a pot, or a can after the rest has been poured out. Legally, the residue is the
               remainder of the money in an estate, after bills and taxes have been paid. So if your millionaire aunt leaves you her estate, but didn‚Äôt pay
               any bills for the last ten years, you may not get much residue![0m
