[36m         LONG  The word ridicule is related to ridiculous. If you ridicule a friend, you try to make them look ridiculous. But now that isn't very friendly! Both words come
               from the Latin redire which means to laugh. When you are ridiculed, you are made a laughing stock, but being the object of ridicule is never
               funny.[0m
