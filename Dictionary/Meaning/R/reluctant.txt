[91m        SHORT  If the adjective reluctant applies to you, it means that you are undergoing some inner struggle and are unwilling or unable to decide.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word reluctant comes from the Latin reluctantem, which means "to struggle against." These days reluctant means ‚Äúunwilling.‚Äù If you‚Äôre reluctant to dance
               to a terrible song, you‚Äôre unwilling to shake your booty, and you might even have to struggle against your friends who try to get you on the
               dance floor. You might offer them a reluctant smile instead (and hope it doesn‚Äôt look like a grimace).[0m
