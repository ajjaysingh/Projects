[36m         LONG  To resuscitate is to revive someone who has passed out: this act is called resuscitation. If someone needs resuscitation, something serious has happened тАФ the
               person has lost consciousness and may be on the verge of death. You've probably heard of "mouth-to-mouth resuscitation," which is one method of
