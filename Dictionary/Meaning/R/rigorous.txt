[36m         LONG  The Latin root for rigorous is rigor, meaning “stiffness.” This might remind you or rigor mortis, the stiffening of a body after death, as often seen on cop
               shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering the meaning of rigorous: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about the standards of
               their work. This requires being alive, of course.[0m
