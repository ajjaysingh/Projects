[91m        SHORT  You may have heard it said that the fastest way to a person‚Äôs heart is through his stomach. So, if you need to please or impress someone, regale them ‚Äî that
               is, treat them to lavish food and drink.[0m
[36m         LONG  While food is reliable way to regale someone, regale can also involve providing forms of entertainment such as music or storytelling. Regale is akin to the
               word gala, meaning ‚Äúa festive party,‚Äù and gallant, which can mean ‚Äúspirited and adventurous‚Äù (though gallant can also mean ‚Äúnoble and brave‚Äù).
               If you regale someone with a gala attended by partygoers who are gallant, in either sense of the word, everyone should have a pretty good time.[0m
