[91m        SHORT  The adjective rambling means confused and long-winded, the way you could describe your grandfather's endless rambling stories of his childhood.[0m
[36m         LONG  Rambling always means indirect and a little confusing, which can be a negative quality in a classroom lecture or movie plot ‚Äî but when you're talking about a
               path through the woods, rambling is a charming way to describe it. You might love to hike through the woods on rambling trails that twist and
               turn. Rambling comes from the verb ramble, "walk or stroll," which is a variant on the older verb romen, "to walk, or to go," and related to
               "roam."[0m
