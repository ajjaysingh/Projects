[91m        SHORT  The verb recuse is used in legal situations and means to remove someone from a position of judicial authority, either a judge or a member of a jury, who is
               deemed unacceptable to judge, usually because of some bias.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin recusare, meaning "to refuse" is the place to start in the history of recuse.  You can recuse someone else, but also yourself.  As the sister-in-law
               of the person accused of stealing 400 gallons of pudding from the local pudding factory, you had no choice but to recuse yourself from judging
               the trial.  Too bad, it sounds like an interesting one.[0m
