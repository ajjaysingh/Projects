  SHORT        If you are building a sand castle and want it to be extra realistic, don’t forget the rampart. This protective wall may not keep the ocean away, but it might
               intimidate a few hostile hermit crabs.
  LONG         This noun is derived from the French verb remparer, meaning “to fortify,” and dates back to the 16th century. This usually refers to a large defensive wall
               surrounding a castle, but can be a barrier built along a road or an embankment constructed alongside a river. This word is famously used in the
               lyrics of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the national anthem of the United States: “O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming...”

     >         Who among us — and I don’t blame our failing schools for this — even knows what “ramparts” are?
     >         Like Conwy, Caernarfon is an Edward I garrison town; the city still follows the original, medieval grid plan laid within its well-preserved ramparts.
     >         Defense attorneys compared the Bakersfield situation to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Rampart scandal in the late 1990s, in which corrupt officers
               tainted cases.
     >         It demolished a dusty rampart along the border with Syria in an act supposedly symbolizing the smashing of colonial boundaries.
     >         You get a real feel for the medieval world as you twist through its towers and ramble over its ramparts.
