[91m        SHORT  A ream is a quantity of paper sold in a bundle, once comprised of 480 sheets but now rounded up to 500.  If you write reams of love letters to your beloved, I
               hope she appreciates them.  Or at least recycles.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word ream has two distinct meanings, depending on whether you use it as a noun or a verb. As a noun, it refers to an amount of paper, its origin from the
               Arabic rizmah, or "bundle." As a verb, ream is a rough word that can mean "to make a hole in" or "to squeeze."  When you "ream someone out" you
               give them a scolding.[0m
