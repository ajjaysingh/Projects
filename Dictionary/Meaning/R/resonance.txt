[91m        SHORT  If you have a loud, deep voice, then your voice has resonance, and if your words are powerful and meaningful, then your words have resonance, too. Something
               with resonance has a deep tone or a powerful lasting effect.[0m
[36m         LONG  Resonance is the quality of being ‚Äúresonant,‚Äù which can mean ‚Äústrong and deep in tone‚Äù or ‚Äúhaving a lasting effect.‚Äù If your voice has resonance, you might
               consider a profession that involves public speaking. Perhaps you'll become a politician and deliver speeches that have a lasting effect, or
               resonance, with your audience. Rooms that intensify sound, like many gymnasiums, can also be said to have resonance.[0m
