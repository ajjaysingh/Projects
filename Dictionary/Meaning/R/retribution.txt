[36m         LONG  Retribution comes from the Latin for giving back what's due, either reward or punishment. But when we talk about retribution, we only talk about punishment.
               The old punishment code of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," is an example of retribution. Some people think about large events like
               tornados or earthquakes as cosmic retribution for human pride. Some synonyms are compensation, recompense, requital.[0m
