[91m        SHORT  Tautology is useless restatement, or saying the same thing twice using different words. “Speedy sprint" is a tautology because sprint already means "speedy
               running."[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun tautology originates from the Greek word tautologos, meaning “repeating what is said.”  "From the public view's perspective" is a tautology in which
               the words perspective and view repeat the same idea. In the study of logic, a tautology is a statement that is necessarily true under any
               interpretation. "It will snow tomorrow, or it will not snow tomorrow" is an example. No argument here — it's true any way you look at it.[0m
