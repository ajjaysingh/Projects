[91m        SHORT  If you are writing a report on climate change and you ignore evidence that the earth is warming, the paper might be called tendentious. Tendentious means
               promoting a specific, and controversial, point of view.[0m
[36m         LONG  When something is tendentious, it shows a bias towards a particular point of view, especially one that people disagree about. It shares a root with the word,
               tendency, which means leaning towards acting a certain way. If you have the tendency to talk in a tendentious manner about politics, people
               might tend to avoid you at parties.[0m
