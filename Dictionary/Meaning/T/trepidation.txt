[91m        SHORT  When plain old "fear" isn't enough to get across a deep feeling of dread about something on the horizon, use the more formal word trepidation.[0m
[36m         LONG  "It was with a certain trepidation that I attended an advance screening of Rob Zombie's Halloween in Hollywood last night," wrote a film reviewer. Some
               dictionaries note that trepidation carries connotations of apprehension about an upcoming threat. In most cases, though, you can get by with
               the simpler word  fear â€” why use three syllables when you could make do with one? The word comes from the Latin verb trepidare, "to tremble."[0m
