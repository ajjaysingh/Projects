[91m        SHORT  To talk carefully without hurting anyone‚Äôs feelings, that‚Äôs tact.  Politicians have tact, which makes them good at speaking about sensitive matters without
               making fools of themselves.  At least, sometimes they have tact.[0m
[36m         LONG  Around a friend who‚Äôs afraid of snakes, you use tact when talking about reptiles because you don‚Äôt want to upset them.  The Latin root word tangere means
               ‚Äútouch,‚Äù and a person with tact avoids touching dangerous words like they are an electric fence.  When you say something without tact, you ‚Äúput
               your foot in your mouth,‚Äù as the phrase goes.  You don‚Äôt literally put your foot in your mouth, although if you did you‚Äôd avoid offending
               people with words.[0m
