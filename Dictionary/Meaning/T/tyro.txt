[91m        SHORT  A tyro is a beginner, a new recruit, or someone who is just learning something. If you are the new guy at the job and you're wearing a big dorky badge that
               says "Trainee" on it, you are a tyro.[0m
[36m         LONG  Tyro isn't used much these days but it's similar to newbie, novice, or recruit. We have all been tyros at some point, but it doesn't necessarily prevent us
               from hazing the new kid, the next-generation tyro. Tyro can also be used as an adjective to describe someone new to a particular scene ‚Äî such
               as "the tyro congressman" or "the tyro quarterback."[0m
