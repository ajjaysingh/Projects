[91m        SHORT  Theology is the study of religion, plain and simple.  Of course, religion isn‚Äôt simple, so theology covers a lot of subjects, like rituals, divine beings, the
               history of religions, and the concept of religious truth.[0m
[36m         LONG  Theology is taught to priests and ministers so they can better understand their religion, and it‚Äôs also taught in non-religious colleges to anyone who is
               curious about the ideas and effects of religion.  The first half of theology is theo-, which means god in Greek. The suffix -logy means ‚Äúthe
               study of,‚Äù so theology literally means ‚Äúthe study of god," but we usually expand it to mean the study of religion more broadly.[0m
