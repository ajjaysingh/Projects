[91m        SHORT  To traduce is to badmouth someone or something. If you don't want people talking trash about you, then don't traduce them either — even if they started it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Among cabaret performers, there is long tradition of traducing other performers — though at its heart, it's really a way of showing affection. Showing love by
               being mean: such is the strange world of camp. Of course, in order to know that a person is being funny when they traduce another person, you
               usually have to know them both pretty well. So if you're not either very familiar or very funny, avoid traducing other people for laughs:
               they're likely to think that you meant all those nasty things.[0m

      Origin:  mid 16th century (in the sense ‘transport, transmit’): from Latin traducere ‘lead in front of others, expose to ridicule’, from trans- ‘over, across’ + ducere
               ‘to lead’.
