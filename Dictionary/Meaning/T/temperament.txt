[91m        SHORT  While a mood can change, your temperament is your overall tone most of the time. Just like dogs, people have temperaments: some are aggressive; some are

[36m         LONG  Just as a temperature gives a reading of how hot or cold something is, your temperament gives a reading of your disposition, or general outlook. Some folks
               with optimistic temperaments see that glass as half full; other more pessimistic folks see it as half empty. And there are still others who
               prefer to drink straight from the bottle.[0m
