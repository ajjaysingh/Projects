[36m         LONG  The word tempo came into English by way of Italian, tracing all the way back to the Latin word tempus, meaning time. It was originally used to describe the
               timing of music, or the speed at which a piece of music is played. For example, a soothing song would be described as a slow tempo song. Tempo
               is still used in this way to describe music, but you‚Äôll also hear it used to refer to pace or speed in general, as in ‚Äî "the increased tempo at
               the end of a close basketball game" or "the slow tempo of action in a novel."[0m
