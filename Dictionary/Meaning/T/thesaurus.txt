[91m        SHORT  A thesaurus is a reference book (or a really cool website, like the Visual Thesaurus) with an organized list of words and their synonyms.[0m
[36m         LONG  An Englishman named Peter Roget published the first modern English thesaurus in 1852. Roget had severe depression, and one of the ways he coped was to put his
               list-making and lexicographical (word analyzing) skills to use in a reference book that would group words, not alphabetically, but according to
               how similar their meanings were. This being the middle of the 19th century, there were no computers: Roget compiled and sorted all of his lists
               by hand.[0m

[3m             > “Fancy language, senator. I will duel you at dawn you charlatan, you mountebank, you mendacious flimflamming dissembler. Bring a pistol and a thesaurus,” he
               quipped.[0m
[3m             > A thesaurus may list the two words as synonyms, but Day does not consider them interchangeable.[0m
[3m             > Borrowing from Roget’s Thesaurus, how about a system ranging from “fib” to “fiction” to “fabrication” to “deception” to “dishonesty” to “falsehood” to
               “perjury.”[0m
