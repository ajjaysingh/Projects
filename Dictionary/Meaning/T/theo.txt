[91m        SHORT  When you have a theory, you have a set of beliefs or principles that might not be proven yet. Does anyone have a good theory for where missing socks go when
               you do laundry?[0m
[36m         LONG  A theory is a set of accepted beliefs or organized principles that explain and guide analysis and one of the ways that theory is defined is that it is
               different from practice, when certain principles are tested. For example, you could be a musician who plays well but who doesn't have a lot of
               experience with the theory of music. This word is a noun and comes from the Greek theoria, which means "contemplation or speculation."[0m
