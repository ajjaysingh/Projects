[91m        SHORT  When you trivialize something, you make it seem less important than it really is. Some people complain that TV news tends to trivialize complicated political
               stories.[0m
[36m         LONG  If your friend tends to trivialize your problems and worries, he dismisses them as being too small to fret about, which might make you feel like he's not
               taking you seriously. If you trivialize your own health concerns, other people might not realize how sick you're feeling. When you trivialize
               an issue, you make it look more trivial than it is, or less significant. The Latin root of both trivialize and trivial is trivialis, "common,
               commonplace, or vulgar."[0m
