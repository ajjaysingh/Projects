[91m        SHORT  If you spin yourself around until you are dizzy, you will likely totter if you try to step forward. Totter is a verb that means "move unsteadily, as though
               you are about to fall down."[0m
[36m         LONG  To totter is to move in a wobbly, unsteady manner. When a person totters, they look like they are going to fall down. In a boxing match, a boxer might totter
               after taking a blow to the head. During an earthquake, buildings may totter, or sway, appearing as though they may fall down. Totter can also
               imply a rocking motion; a playground seesaw, for instance, is sometimes called "a teeter-totter."[0m
