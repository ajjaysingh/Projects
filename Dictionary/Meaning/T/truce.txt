[36m         LONG  When there's a truce, the two sides stop attacking each other, catch their breath, and try to work out a peace deal. A truce isn't a permanent solution: it's
               more like a time-out. People with other kinds of conflicts talk about truces, too. If you and your sister are in an ongoing battle, one of you
               could say, "Can we please call a truce?" That means you'll take a break from squabbling, at least for a while.[0m
