[91m        SHORT  When you can touch something, it's tangible: "I need tangible proof that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!"[0m
[36m         LONG  Tangible is from Latin tangere "to touch," and it simply means something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in metaphorical senses: "tangible
               assets" have a value that can be precisely measured, and "tangible grief" can be clearly sensed by an onlooker. So you might not need to
               physically touch something for it to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts: "Has the teen pop star demonstrated any
               tangible ability to sing?"[0m
