[36m         LONG  Whenever you confine a person or an animal to keep them in one place, they're tethered. A bank robber might leave his hostages tethered together in the vault,
               and you might keep your fence-jumping dog tethered to the porch when she's out in your yard. The root word is the Old Norse tjoÃ°r, tether,
               which was used only as a noun to describe the rope that ties animals until the late 15th century, when the verb form developed.[0m
