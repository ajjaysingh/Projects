[91m        SHORT  When you want to indicate that something is silly or overused, you would call it trite. A love song with lyrics about holding hands in the sunshine? Totally
               trite.[0m
[36m         LONG  Trite has a Latin root, the past participle of terere, meaning "wear out." An old-fashioned or outdated definition of the word is "frayed or worn out by use,"
               and you can see how the meaning for an object that is worn out can be applied to an idea that has been used to the point of being meaningless.
               The antonym of this word is original.[0m
