[91m        SHORT  A travesty is a cheap mockery, usually of something or someone serious, such as a travesty of justice.[0m
[36m         LONG  A travesty is a silly imitation, like a tall young man dressed up like a little old lady. Travesty and transvestite both come from French travesti meaning
               "dressed in disguise," so it helps to remember the definition of travesty by thinking of that football player in drag. A travesty can be more
               than that, though. A travesty of justice, for example, is a court case that makes a mockery of the system, or so you might think if the verdict
               isn't in your favor. There are lots of examples in literature: the book Don Quixote is a travesty of Medieval Romance.[0m

      Origin:  mid 17th century (as an adjective in the sense ‘dressed to appear ridiculous’): from French travesti ‘disguised’, past participle of travestir, from Italian
               travestire, from trans- ‘across’ + vestire ‘clothe’.
