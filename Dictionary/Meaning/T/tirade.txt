[91m        SHORT  A tirade is a speech, usually consisting of a long string of violent, emotionally charged words. Borrow and lose your roommate’s clothes one too many times,
               and you can bet you’ll be treated to a heated tirade.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun tirade is related to the Italian word tirata, which means "volley." So imagine a very angry person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in
               your direction when you want to remember what  tirade means. Although, tirades don't necessarily have to include bad words — any long, drawn
               out speech or epic declaration can be called a tirade.[0m
