                                                                                      TIRADE                                                                                      
  SHORT        A tirade is a speech, usually consisting of a long string of violent, emotionally charged words. Borrow and lose your roommate’s clothes one too many times,
               and you can bet you’ll be treated to a heated tirade.
  LONG         The noun tirade is related to the Italian word tirata, which means "volley." So imagine a very angry person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in
               your direction when you want to remember what  tirade means. Although, tirades don't necessarily have to include bad words — any long, drawn
               out speech or epic declaration can be called a tirade.

     >         Like Chavez before him, Maduro often singles out the long-haired, U.S.-educated Mendoza in public tirades, accusing him of hoarding products and provoking
               shortages.
     >         When the tirade is over, you can ask questions to clarify what it is that has angered them.
