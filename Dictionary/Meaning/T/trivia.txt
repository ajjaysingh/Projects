[91m        SHORT  Can you name the twenty-third vice-president? Do you know all the state birds? If so, you must be good at trivia: facts that are interesting but not

[36m         LONG  Everybody probably knows trivia about something they enjoy. Baseball fans can quote batting averages of their favorite players; movie nuts can tell you
               exactly what films their favorite actors appeared in and who they played. The game "Trivial Pursuit" is full of questions about facts like
               that. Why would anyone bother with trivia? Usually, because they love the topic, or maybe they need to know it for their job. One person's
               trivia is another person's important information.[0m
