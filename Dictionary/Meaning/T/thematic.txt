[91m        SHORT  When you visit a museum and the cat paintings are grouped together in one room, and the fruit paintings in another, you could conclude that the curator favors

               them more easily. That song your garage band has been working on has a thematic development, too, starting with a line of melody, changing it a
               little, taking it in a different direction, then returning to the theme.[0m
