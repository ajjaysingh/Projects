[91m        SHORT  Thorough describes something that is painstakingly complete, like a thorough search for your missing keys in which you look for them in coat pockets, under
               the table, in the refrigerator ‚Äî in every single place you can think of.[0m
[36m         LONG  Thorough rhymes with "burrow": "THUR-oh." It looks a lot like through but remember thorough is an adjective, so you might use it to describe a thorough
               investigation or a thorough review. In contrast through is used most often as a preposition ‚Äî you might look through every drawer, for example,
               in a search ‚Äî or as an adverb ‚Äî you might see a hole in your pocket where coins fall through.[0m
