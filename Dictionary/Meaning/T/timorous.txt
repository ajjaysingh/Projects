[36m         LONG  The adjective timorous is actually the Latin word for ”fearful.” But timorous is a specific kind of fearfulness — the kind that strikes people before giving a
               speech, or walking into a crowded place where people are socializing. Also called "shy" or "timid," timorous people often become more
               comfortable when they see a familiar face in the crowd.[0m
