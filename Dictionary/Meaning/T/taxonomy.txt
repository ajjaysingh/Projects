[91m        SHORT  Taxonomy is all about organizing and classifying. To make it sound more scientific, you could refer to your project of reorganizing your spice rack according
               to smell as a taxonomy of spices.[0m
[36m         LONG  Taxonomy is a word used mainly in biology to talk about classifying living organisms, organizing them according to their similarities. If you've ever seen a
               chart with animals divided into species, genus, and family, you know what scientific taxonomy is. The word comes very straightforwardly from
               Greek words for "arrangement" ‚Äî taxis ‚Äî and "method" ‚Äî nomia. So any special method for arranging or organizing things can be called taxonomy.[0m
