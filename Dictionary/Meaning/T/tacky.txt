               showy â€” obnoxious. When people make tasteless, trashy comments, it's also considered tacky. But if you're in art class and someone says that
               your paper-mÃ¢chÃ© project is tacky, don't get mad â€” they probably just mean that it's not dry yet and still sticky to the touch.[0m
