[91m        SHORT  If your teacher says your position on the benefits of abolishing homework is not tenable, she means it is not based in fact. To be tenable is to be evidence-
               based and well-founded.[0m
[36m         LONG  Tenable comes from the Latin root tenir which means "to hold," as in "hold together." If your plan is tenable, it will probably hold together when you execute
               it, or hold up to scrutiny. It's good to note that the opposite of tenable is untenable and not intenable, though throughout history both have
               been used.[0m
