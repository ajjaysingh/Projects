[91m        SHORT  A tremor is a trembling or shaking in a person or the Earth. If you're scared about speaking in public you might have a tremor in your voice ‚Äî or wish that an
               earthquake tremor would open up the floor and swallow you first.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you're nervous or feeling queasy as you read a paper aloud, you might get a tremor in your hands and the paper itself will start to shake. When an
               earthquake rumbles, a powerful tremor might make a building shake so that it looks as fragile as a piece of paper. Not every tremor comes from
               fear or seismic activity, though: you can tremor or quiver with excitement as you anticipate something enjoyable.[0m
