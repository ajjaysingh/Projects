[91m        SHORT  A tactical move on the military's part is one that is carefully planned and often small in scale, but important in getting control of an area.[0m
[36m         LONG  Tactical comes from the Greek taktike techne meaning "art of arrangement." When something is tactical, it is artfully arranged, or planned. This most often
               refers to military or naval operations, but it doesn't have to.  When someone does something with a goal that is beyond the immediate result of
               his action, that can be seen as a tactical move. For example, renovating your kitchen might be a tactical move if you're planning to eventually
               sell your house and want to increase its property value.[0m
