[91m        SHORT  Tranquillity is a sense of peace and quiet. It is the feeling you have while sitting under a starry sky, listening to the crickets. The aura of tranquility
               comes from the calm in the world, which makes you feel you are without a care in the world.[0m
[36m         LONG  Tranquillity is also sometimes spelled with one l as tranquility. Its roots are in the Latin trans meaning "exceedingly" and quies meaning "rest" or "quiet."
               Tranquil means calm, and something that is exceedingly quiet or restful â€” a sunset or a rocking chair in the shade â€” can give you a sense of
               tranquillity or peacefulness.[0m
