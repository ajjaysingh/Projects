[91m        SHORT  Transcendental describes anything that has to do with the spiritual, non-physical world. You could describe the time you spend in the woods hiking as a
               physical and a transcendental experience.[0m
[36m         LONG  When something is transcendental, it's beyond ordinary, everyday experience. It might be religious, spiritual, or otherworldly, but if it's transcendental, it
               transcends ‚Äî or goes beyond ‚Äî the regular physical realm. The adjective transcendental is used to describe a particular kind of meditation, a
               specific school of philosophy, and even a type of number in mathematics. Transcendental and transcend come from the Latin word transcendere, or
               climb over or beyond.[0m
