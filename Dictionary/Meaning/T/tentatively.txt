[91m        SHORT  Tentatively means hesitantly, like how you go about a delicate or dangerous situation. It also refers to uncertainty, like when you tentatively make plans to
               go to a party, even though you don't have a ride yet.[0m

               Think of how you slowly wade into a freezing cold pool. You’re moving tentatively, because you know it’s going to be a shock and you want to
               give your body time to adjust. The opposite of tentatively is certainly, a word that indicates no hesitation.[0m
