[91m        SHORT  To trudge is to walk in a heavy, exhausted way. Your grandpa probably tells you about how he used to trudge six miles uphill through a foot of snow in the
               brutal cold every morning just to get to school.[0m
[36m         LONG  Trudge is also a noun that means a difficult, labored walk. If you take a mile-long trudge through heavy snow or mud, your steps will be slower and it will
               require more effort to put one foot in front of the other. Need help remembering what trudge means? Say it out loud. Trudge rhymes with sludge
               â€” and walking through sludge, or thick muck, would cause you to trudge.[0m
