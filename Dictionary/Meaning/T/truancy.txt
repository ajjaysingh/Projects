[91m        SHORT  If you pretend you're sick to stay home from school and then sneak out to a baseball game, that's truancy, meaning it‚Äôs an unauthorized absence.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Middle English, truant ‚Äî the root of truancy ‚Äî referred to a vagabond or an idler. That meaning still holds true: if you‚Äôre accused of truancy, some may
               say you‚Äôre a vagabond or an idler ‚Äî meaning you‚Äôre shirking your duties. Truancy can refer to any absence without permission, but it often
               refers to  being absent from school. If you stay home from school without good reason, you might be hauled into the principal‚Äôs office to
               explain your truancy.[0m
