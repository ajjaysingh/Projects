[36m         LONG  Anything that thaws is warming up after a frigid or chilly period. The weather thaws when spring hits, especially after a bad winter. When you take food out
               of the freezer, it thaws. When you have an unpleasant relationship with someone, that can thaw too. A warm, friendly gesture from one person to
               another can be a sign that their cold relationship is thawing. When you think of thawing, think "Warming up."[0m
