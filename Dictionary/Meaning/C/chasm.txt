[91m        SHORT  A chasm is a deep divide, either literal or figurative, such as a giant chasm in an ice cap or the growing chasm between two friends who haven't spoken in a

[36m         LONG  The first syllable in chasm sounds like cat without the t sound: "CA-zum". It comes from the Greek word khasma, meaning "yawning hollow, gulf" and was
               originally used to describe a split in a land formation, such as a deep crack caused by an earthquake. The word still retains that sense, but
               today can also mean "a profound division between people or beliefs," such as a chasm between Republicans and Democrats.[0m
