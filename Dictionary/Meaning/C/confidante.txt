[91m        SHORT  If you're a confidante, two things must be true: you have to be female, and you must be someone who people feel comfortable telling secrets to.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you have a confidante, you're lucky. She is a friend you can confide in, someone you trust with your private thoughts, and who you're sure can keep a
               secret. If your trusted friend is male, you call him your confidant. In fact, you could call a male or a female "secret keeper" your confidant
               (without the "e"). Both versions of the word come from the same root as confident — which you can trace back to the Latin word meaning "to
               trust or confide," confidentem.[0m

      Origin:  mid 17th century: alteration of confident (as a noun in the same sense in the early 17th century), probably to represent the pronunciation of French
               confidente ‘having full trust’.
