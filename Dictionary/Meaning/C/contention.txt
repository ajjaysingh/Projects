[91m        SHORT  There is nothing "content," or satisfying, about being in contention, and that's probably because the word contention means being in a competition that ends

[36m         LONG  "And in this corner, the contender" is heard at most boxing matches to describe each of the fighters about to go into contention in the ring. Sometimes,
               though, a contention can be a battle of words or a struggle between two parties over a single point. The expression "bone of contention"
               describes a narrow object of disagreement that reaches the level of strife, or contention. For two hungry dogs, though, the bone of contention
               might be a serious matter.[0m
