[91m        SHORT  A citadel is a fortified structure designed to provide protection during a battle. So, back in the days when pillaging was commonplace, it was a good idea to
               know where your nearest citadel was.[0m
[36m         LONG  Among the most historically famous citadels are the Acropolis in Athens and the Tower of London. Even though we're building fewer physical fortresses these
               days, citadel remains a useful word, particularly when you need to create a metaphor suggesting strength and safety. As poet John Keats wrote,
               "[I]t appears to me that almost any man may like the spider spin from his own inwards his own airy citadel."[0m
