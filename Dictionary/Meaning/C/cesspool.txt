[91m        SHORT  Literally, a cesspool is place underground where sewage gathers, but figuratively, you might hear anything that's full of germs or just plain disgusting
               described as a cesspool. Either way, you'll want to steer clear.[0m
[36m         LONG  Think of a cesspool as an underground swimming pool full of nastiness, which of course rhymes with cess.  But the word cesspool isn't just used to describe a
               storage place underground where sewage is held temporarily. It's also a term you might use to negatively describe something that's swimming in
               germs or corruption. Stuck on a long flight between two people with a cold? That's a cesspool of germs right there for you.[0m

      Origin:  late 17th century (denoting a trap under a drain to catch solids): probably an alteration, influenced by pool1, of archaic suspiral ‘vent, water pipe,
               settling tank’, from Old French souspirail ‘air hole’, based on Latin sub- ‘from below’ + spirare ‘breathe’.
