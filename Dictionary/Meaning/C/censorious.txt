[36m         LONG  Censorious, pronounced "sen-SOAR-ee-us," comes from the Latin word censura, meaning "judgment." Someone who is censorious judges everyone and everything,
               ruining everyone's good time with harsh criticisms. The sky is too blue. Your dog is too friendly. The zebra has too many stripes. You get the
               idea. A censorious person makes others say, "So...is there anything you do like?"[0m
