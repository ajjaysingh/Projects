[91m        SHORT  In the truest sense, contrition is feeling sorry for committing a religious sin and being scared about the consequences. But anyone can feel general
               contrition for something they've done wrong.[0m
[36m         LONG  Contrition is a strong, powerful feeling that people get when they've done something wrong. Originally, this feeling came from having sinned and a fear of
               going to hell for it. But over the years, the idea of contrition has gotten broader. Anyone can feel contrition if they do something wrong,
               whether it's a tiny thing like littering or a huge thing like murdering. If you did wrong and feel bad about it, you're feeling contrition —
               you're contrite.[0m
