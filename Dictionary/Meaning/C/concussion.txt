[91m        SHORT  A concussion is a violent blow, especially to the head, that often injures the brain or causes a loss of consciousness ‚Äî an all-too-frequent occurrence,
               unfortunately, in contact sports like football or boxing.[0m
[36m         LONG  First used around 1400, concussion originates from the Latin concussionem, which means "a shaking." Your brain certainly gets "a shaking" when you take a
               heavy blow to the head, which sometimes causes injury or permanent damage. It's not just people, though, who get concussions; a building can
               also suffer from a concussion during an earthquake.[0m
