[91m        SHORT  The verb convene is a somewhat formal way of saying "to bring together for the purpose of a meeting."[0m
[36m         LONG  Convene is one of those words that lend an air of formality to a situation. We use it in place of the words "call a meeting" for such situations as government
               assemblages, court hearings, and conferences. Its meaning can be easily seen in its history ‚Äî it comes from the Latin con-, which means
               "together," and the verb venƒ´re, "to come." Imagine, if the syllables had just fit the music, the John Lennon song "Come together," might have
               been called Convene.[0m
