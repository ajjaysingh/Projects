[91m        SHORT  To chasten someone is to correct him or her, often with the use of some pretty steep punishment. Chasten can also mean "to restrain." Either of these actions
               may be necessary when someone isn't behaving like they're supposed to.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb chasten is often used with the verb "to be" as in "be chastened." If students are caught writing graffiti on the bathroom wall, you can expect them
               to "be chastened" by both the school and their parents. Chasten is related to the word chastise, meaning "to punish severely." Both words can
               be traced back to the Latin root castus, meaning "morally pure." So keep yourself on the straight and narrow when it comes to morality and you
               can avoid being chastened.[0m
