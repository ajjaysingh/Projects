[36m         LONG  When the word coup is used on the nightly news, it's usually describing a military government takeover. In the business section of the daily newspaper,  coup
               might refer to a big corporation landing an important contract or deal. However you use the word coup, don't say the "p" at the end. It's not
               pronounced like chicken coop. It sounds more like a dove's coo.[0m
