[91m        SHORT  If you and your friends launch into singing ‚ÄúOld MacDonald‚Äù loudly together, in the middle of the public library, you will all have made a concerted, or
               cooperative, effort to annoy lots of people.[0m
[36m         LONG  Concerted is often used to describe a group effort to achieve a particular goal. As you may have guessed, concerted comes from the word concert. While a
               concert can be defined as "a group of musicians playing cooperatively," concert can also designate other types of cooperative behavior. If a
               group of people do anything together ‚Äî from singing an annoying song to throwing library books at agreed-upon targets ‚Äî they are acting in
               concert, or in a concerted manner.[0m
