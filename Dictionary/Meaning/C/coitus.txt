[91m        SHORT  Coitus is a word for sex, specifically vaginal sex that includes penetration and ejaculation. A couple has achieved coitus when they've had sex.[0m
[36m         LONG  This word may sound a little unusual to you because it's an old technical term for sex. Very few friends sitting around talking about sex will describe it as
               coitus, unless they're talking about The Big Lebowski, a movie that makes humorous mention of this old-fashioned term. Coitus may remind you of
               copulation and fornication: two other fancy words for sex.[0m
