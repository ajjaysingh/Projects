[91m        SHORT  The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance.[0m
[36m         LONG  Countenance comes from a French word for "behavior," but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: "He had a puzzled
               countenance," or "what a charming countenance!" Countenance can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or approve. If someone does something
               offensive, tell them, "I'm afraid I can't countenance that."[0m
