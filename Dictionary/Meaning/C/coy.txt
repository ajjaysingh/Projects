[91m        SHORT  Take the adjective coy for a person who pretends to be shy but really isn't, or someone who could give a definite answer but won't. Coy behavior can be
               playful or just plain annoying.[0m
[36m         LONG  Originally meaning "quiet and shy," today someone who is coy pretends to be shy in a playful manner ‚Äî often as a form of flirting. If a politician is coy
               about something, he or she only gives vague statements on an issue for fear of committing to a position or angering his or her constituency.
               Common to both of these senses is the fact that a person uses coyness to subtly manipulate his or her audience.[0m
