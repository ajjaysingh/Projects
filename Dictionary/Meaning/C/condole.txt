[91m        SHORT  When you condole, you express your sadness at someone's death. Sending a "condolence" card is one way to condole with someone who has lost a loved one.[0m
[36m         LONG  When my dog died, I found that other dog owners were more likely to condole with me, since those friends who never had a pet had a harder time understanding
               how profound my loss was. There are many ways to condole when someone needs comfort after having suffered a loss. You can send a card, you can
               visit, bring food, or just sit with them as they grieve. If you've lost someone too, then you condole by showing empathy. If not, then you can
               condole by just lending an ear.[0m
