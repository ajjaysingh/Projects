[91m        SHORT  No reason to get excited ‚Äî cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy
               studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning "rapid," which comes from the Latin word "cursorius," meaning "hasty, of a race
               or running." Something that is cursory is done quickly, like a teacher who takes a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade
               them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.[0m
