[91m        SHORT  When a group of people or nations form an alliance, it is called a confederation, allowing each member to govern itself but agreeing to work together for
               common causes. Perhaps the best-known confederation was the South during the U.S. Civil War.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun confederation comes from the early 15th Century, meaning ‚Äúan agreement.‚Äù  Confederation is similar to the word "federation," but with important
               differences. Whereas a federation has a strong central government, a confederation is more of an agreement between separate bodies to cooperate
               with each other. The European alliance could be called a confederation, while the United States is a federation.[0m
