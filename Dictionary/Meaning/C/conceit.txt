[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre always boasting and can‚Äôt stop talking about yourself, you have that character flaw known as conceit. Your friends ‚Äî if you have any ‚Äî may also
               complain about your arrogance, vanity, and egotism.[0m

               in song. You might find an architectural conceit in a Baroque palace, where you think you‚Äôre looking down a long hallway lined with columns,
               but when you get closer you see that it's really a mural painted in perspective so that the columns only seem to disappear in the distance.[0m
