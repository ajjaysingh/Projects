[91m        SHORT  When people discuss politics and mention the word conservatism, they're talking about a philosophy that favors making few changes in society, sticking with
               traditions, and often spending as little money as possible.[0m
[36m         LONG  Conservatism is most often used to describe the beliefs of right-wing politicians and the people who tend to vote for them. There are some who practice fiscal
               conservatism ‚Äî which focuses on reducing spending and cutting budgets ‚Äî while being more liberal socially. Social conservatism tends to favor
               things like traditional roles for women and men, and to object to major changes in society like same sex marriage. A person who embraces
               conservatism is called a conservative.[0m
