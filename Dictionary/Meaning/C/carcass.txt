  SHORT        In the aftermath of Thanksgiving, after turkey sandwiches and turkey noodle soup and picking all the meat off, you're left with nothing more than turkey bones
               â€” or the carcass of your holiday bird.
  LONG         The gruesome word carcass is often used to describe the remains of a dead animal, especially one that's been slaughtered for food. But if that makes you
               squeamish, you can think of carcasses in a more figurative light, because a carcass could also mean "the inner structure of something." The
               carcass of an old burned out building, for example, refers to its remaining walls and beams. Or think of the carcass of the couch, its inner
               foundation, which is supporting your rear right now.

     >         Harvested elk will be tested for CWD, and carcasses that are free of the disease will be processed.
     >         Tennessee has carcass import restrictions from 24 states and two Canadian provinces.
     >         A federal lab in Iowa is studying the carcass to see if the diagnosis was accurate.
     >         Collecting data and tracking carcass routes were his main priorities, but Brinegar said he also kept an eye out for salmon poachers.
