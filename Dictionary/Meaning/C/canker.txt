[91m        SHORT  A canker is a kind of sore. Some people are prone to getting cankers on their mouths. Canker can also refer to anything that is terrible and difficult to get
               rid of. Your parents might complain that the abandoned, run-down house two blocks away is a canker on your neighborhood.[0m
[36m         LONG  In medicine, cankers are ulcers that are difficult to treat (the word is closely related to cancer). In agriculture, canker refers to a fungal disease that
               attacks the bark of trees. If one kid in your class misbehaves, and everyone suddenly follows his lead, that kid could be described (by your
               teachers) as a canker.[0m
