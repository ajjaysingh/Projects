[91m        SHORT  If someone tends to be hypercritical and find fault with everything, you can describe that person as captious. Try not to be described as a captious person
               yourself, however. No one likes a carping individual![0m
[36m         LONG  Captious comes from the Middle French word captieux, which is from the Latin word captiosus meaning fallacious or deceiving. This is, in fact, another meaning
               for the adjective captious, something is calculated to confuse or deceive ‚Äî such as a captious explanation of the facts. When a person is
               described as captious, the sense is usually of nitpicking at faults or raising petty objections. It is usually used to imply a permanent
               character or personality flaw, as opposed to a momentary lapse in understanding.[0m
