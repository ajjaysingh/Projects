[91m        SHORT  A corpus is a collection of writings. If you tend to never throw anything away, you might have your entire school corpus, from your first scribbled words to

[36m         LONG  The written works of an author, or from one specific time period, can be called a corpus if they're gathered together into a collection or talked about as a
               group. You could discuss the corpus of Dr. Seuss, for example. Corpus sounds a little like corpse, and that's no coincidence; corpus means
               "body" in Latin, and though it's come to mean specifically "body of work," the two words are closely related.[0m
