                                                                                      CORPUS                                                                                      
  SHORT        A corpus is a collection of writings. If you tend to never throw anything away, you might have your entire school corpus, from your first scribbled words to
               your high school English essays.
  LONG         The written works of an author, or from one specific time period, can be called a corpus if they're gathered together into a collection or talked about as a
               group. You could discuss the corpus of Dr. Seuss, for example. Corpus sounds a little like corpse, and that's no coincidence; corpus means
               "body" in Latin, and though it's come to mean specifically "body of work," the two words are closely related.

     >         The bond was set during an appearance this week before a federal magistrate judge in Corpus Christi.
     >         On Tuesday, her lawyer Ambiga, accompanied by Chin’s three sons, filed a habeas corpus application seeking her release.
     >         But brain scans soon after birth showed excess fluid and abnormalities in his cortex and corpus callosum, which separates the two hemispheres.
     >         But Corpus Christi is the much larger of the two cities, a tourism destination, currently undergoing a huge industrial growth spurt.
     >         He also expressed plans to suspend the writ of habeas corpus to strengthen his anti-drug campaign and suppress “rebellion” in Mindanao.
