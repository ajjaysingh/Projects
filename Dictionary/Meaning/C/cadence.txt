[91m        SHORT  The word cadence has its own lovely cadence â€” rhythm of sound as it's spoken.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cadence has come to mean "the rhythm of sounds" from its root cadere which means "to fall." Originally designating falling tones especially at the end of
               lines of music or poetry, cadence broadened to mean the rhythms of the tones and sometimes even the rhythm of sounds in general. Think of the
               cadence of the marching band at a football game or the cadence of the crickets on a warm spring night. You can remember the "fall" idea by
               thinking of one of the only words that contains it â€” decadence â€” which has the prefix de- at the front to mean down, or downfall.[0m
