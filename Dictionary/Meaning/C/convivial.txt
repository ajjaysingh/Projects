[36m         LONG  The Latin word convivium means "a feast," and when convivial was first coined in the 1660s, its meaning related to the excess of food and drink during such
               celebrations. You can also see convivial in convivere, meaning "to carouse together." Just when it seemed all convivial could ever do was
               describe people who overindulge, a new shade of meaning emerged: loving to be around people. After all, a big part of feasting is being with
               people you care about.[0m
