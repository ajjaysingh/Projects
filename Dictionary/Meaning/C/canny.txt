[36m         LONG  In contemporary usage, canny is a synonym for shrewd. Both words mean smart or sharp-witted, but they also suggest that someone is smart in a self-serving and
               possibly even tricky way. Canny is also related to the word cunning ‚Äî another adjective meaning wise, but with negative connotations. Uncanny
               is not the opposite of canny ‚Äî  it means weird or unsettling.[0m
