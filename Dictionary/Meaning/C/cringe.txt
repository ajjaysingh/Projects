[91m        SHORT  When you cringe, your body language shows you don't like what you see and hear. You close your eyes and grimace. You may even jerk your body away from the

[36m         LONG  Whether it's a song you hate or someone mentioning an embarrassing moment from the past, you cringe at things that are unpleasant. If you think about the way

               Old English word cringan, meaning “give way, fall (in battle), become bent.” That’s exactly what your body does when you cringe![0m
