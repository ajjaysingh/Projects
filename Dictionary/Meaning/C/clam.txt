[91m        SHORT  A clam is a marine animal with two shells that eats by straining food from water, sand, or mud. You can sometimes find clams by digging in the sand close to
               the seashore.[0m
[36m         LONG  The largest clams are used for food by humans, including the scallop, a particularly big form of clam. When you order soup in New England, it's not unlikely
               that it will be clam chowder, a creamy, thick stew with potatoes and pieces of clam. When clam is a verb, it means "to dig clams on the beach,"
               and if your friend offers to pay you 1000 clams for your old car, she means "dollars."[0m
