[91m        SHORT  Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and
               manipulation is called chicanery.[0m
[36m         LONG  Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language,
               the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has
               begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next
               election cycle.[0m
