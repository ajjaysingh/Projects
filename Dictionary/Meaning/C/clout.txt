[91m        SHORT  When you speak of someone having clout, it usually means that they communicate a sense of power or influence, particularly in the political sense. "You‚Äôll
               wanna talk to that big guy over there if you want me to let you in. He‚Äôs got clout."[0m
[36m         LONG  Clout can also mean to hit someone really hard ‚Äî either the hit you give (‚Äúthat‚Äôs a big clout he just landed‚Äù) or the act of hitting (‚Äúshe clouted him with a
               baseball bat‚Äù). Of course, the sense of having power and the actual hitting are related, since clout is something to be wielded ‚Äî either
               physically or figuratively. Note: it's not just tough guys who have clout. China is said to have "growing economic clout," and Oprah is known
               to have significant clout in the media industry.[0m
