[91m        SHORT  Don‚Äôt have a conniption! Here‚Äôs the definition ‚Äî a conniption is a temper tantrum, and it‚Äôs not just for toddlers.[0m
[36m         LONG  "Don't have a conniption" is another way of saying, "Take it easy. Don't throw a fit." Conniptions are fits or tantrums. A screaming toddler is a perfect
               example of a conniption, but adults who lose their tempers have conniptions too. People have conniptions when they lose their cool and can't
               control themselves. If you‚Äôve been waiting in line for two hours then someone jumps ahead and takes the last cupcake, go ahead and have a
               conniption.[0m
