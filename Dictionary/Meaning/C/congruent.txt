[36m         LONG  Congruent comes from the Latin verb congruere "to come together, correspond with." Figuratively, the word describes something that is similar in character or
               type. Are your actions congruent with your values? If a friend says something outrageous that you don't want to agree with but don't want to
               disagree with either, say that your friend's idea is congruent with what you think. That way you can agree with him but change your mind later
               if you have to.[0m
