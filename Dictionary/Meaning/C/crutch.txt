[91m        SHORT  A crutch is something you lean on when you‚Äôre hurt or weak. It can be a physical crutch you use because you broke your leg, or a friend you depend on a bit
               too much when you‚Äôre having a tough time.[0m
[36m         LONG  A medical crutch is a device that helps you walk when you‚Äôre injured. A psychological crutch helps you when you need it, or think you do. Medical crutches
               come in pairs and have soft pads that fit under your arms and handles to help you rest your body weight on them. Other types of crutches fit
               securely around the lower part of your arm. The Old English root word is crycce, "staff," and the figurative meaning dates from about 1600.[0m
