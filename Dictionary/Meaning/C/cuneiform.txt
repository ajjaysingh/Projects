[91m        SHORT  Cuneiform is a type of writing that was used in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. In a museum, you might see artifacts such as stone tablets with cuneiform
               carved into them.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cuneiform is typically pronounced "kyoo-NEE-uh-form." Back in Mesopotamian times, you would have written by carving wedge-shaped characters that make up a
               language called cuneiform. From the shape of the characters, we get the adjective cuneiform, which means "wedge-shaped," like a cuneiform
               platter. Cuneiform also describes wedge-shaped bones, like those found in the lower leg.[0m

[3m             > We hear of a three-volume Babylonian history, derived directly from the cuneiform records at Babylon, by a Chaldean priest named Berossus.[0m
[3m             > The tunnels lead to bas-reliefs with inscriptions in cuneiform alphabet and two mural sculptures of four women’s faces from the front.[0m
[3m             > “There are 33 separate recipes, preserved on three different cuneiform tablets,” said Tate Paulette, a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University who studies
               Mesopotamian cuisine.[0m
[3m             > Besides the reliefs and statues, archaeologists dug up hundreds of stone tablets written in cuneiform letters containing everything from treaties to temple
               and palace records.[0m
