[91m        SHORT  A crescent is a thin, curved shape that‚Äôs thicker in the middle and tapers to thin points at each end, like the little sliver of moon you might notice in the
               sky.[0m
[36m         LONG  Crescent was first used to describe the shape of the waxing, or growing moon, and if you listen closely you can hear its similarity to increase. But a
               crescent can be any thin, curved shape. You might see a crescent of light hitting the pavement or a crescent of beach next to the ocean.
               Crescent can also act as an adjective describing something that has that shape, like a crescent moon or a crescent roll.[0m
