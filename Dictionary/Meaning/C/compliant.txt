[91m        SHORT  If you are willing to submit to someone's request, then you are compliant. Parents like it when their teenagers are compliant and follow the rules. Teenagers,
               on the other hand, are probably not as compliant as parents would like to think![0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective compliant can also describe something that is agreeable. "The lawyers made sure that the man's will was fully compliant with state law, so that
               his children could not contest his desire to leave his entire estate to his dog, Fluffy." Or: "That software is not compliant with your
               operating system; you'll have to buy a different version."[0m
