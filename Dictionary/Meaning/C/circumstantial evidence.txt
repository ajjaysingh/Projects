	Wiki Definition:
              	Circumstantial evidence  is  evidence  that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By
               contrast, direct  evidence  supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional  evidence  or inference.
