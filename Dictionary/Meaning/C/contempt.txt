[91m        SHORT  Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a fast-food joint.[0m
[36m         LONG  Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to despise," and if you despise
               someone, you have contempt for them. It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either disdain or scorn.  It suggests
               you find someone or something utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or "Whopper" with a voice dripping in contempt.[0m
