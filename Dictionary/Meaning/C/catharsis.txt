[91m        SHORT  Use the noun catharsis to refer to the experience a person can have of releasing emotional tension and feeling refreshed afterwards.[0m
[36m         LONG  Conceived by Aristotle as the cleansing effect of emotional release that tragic drama has on its audience, catharsis stems from a Greek verb meaning "to
               purify, purge." Today, it can be used to describe any emotional release, including a good long laugh or cry that is followed by a sense of
               balance and freshness afterwards.[0m

      Origin:  early 19th century (in sense 2): from Greek katharsis, from kathairein ‘cleanse’, from katharos ‘pure’. The notion of ‘release’ through drama (sense 1)
               derives from Aristotle's Poetics .
