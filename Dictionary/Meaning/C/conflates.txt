[91m        SHORT  Conflate is a more formal way to say "mix together." You probably wouldn't say you conflated the ingredients for a cake, but if you blended two different
               stories together to make a new one, conflate would work.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb conflate comes to us from the Latin word conflare, which literally means "to blow together." So think of using this word when you want to talk about
               two things getting thrown together and combined. Things that have been conflated often seem mixed up or confused, as when you conflate two
               different ideas, taking parts of one and parts of another to build your own Frankenstein version of things.[0m
