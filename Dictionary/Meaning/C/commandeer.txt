[91m        SHORT  What is that person doing, interrupting everyone and changing the subject every minute? He is trying to commandeer, or take control, of the conversation.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can probably tell from the look of the word that commandeer is somehow related to commander in meaning.  A commander is someone who is officially in
               charge, giving orders and making decisions for a group such as a nation or a military. Many groups don't have a commander, but this doesn't
               stop some people from trying to take charge. If you commandeer something ‚Äî whether it's a car or a conversation ‚Äî you use force to try to take
               over.[0m
