[91m        SHORT  When a military needs people to fight in a war, but there aren‚Äôt enough volunteers, sometimes they'll begin conscription, which is a law that says if you are
               able to fight, you have to fight.[0m
[36m         LONG  Also called the draft, conscription legally requires people to join the army, with penalties if they don‚Äôt.  During the Vietnam War, many U.S. citizens
               protested conscription by burning their draft documents or fleeing to Canada, and some faced prison time because of these actions.  The Latin
               roots of conscription translate to ‚Äúwrite down together,‚Äù which is a much nicer way of saying ‚ÄúGo to war or go to jail.‚Äù[0m
