[91m        SHORT  To cuddle is to embrace in a loving, affectionate way. If you're having a terrible day, you probably wish you could just go home, get in bed, and cuddle with
               your cat.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cuddle might come from the Middle English couth, "known" â€” after all, you only cuddle with those you know. Or, cuddle may have started as baby talk that
               caught on. When you cuddle, you give a snuggly hug to make yourself or another person feel loved or comforted. As a noun, cuddle describes the
               time of the embrace, like having one last cuddle before leaving for a long trip.[0m
