[36m         LONG  The noun crux is often followed by the phrases "of the matter" or "of the problem." When people are trying to identify the crux of something, it's like they
               want to get to the heart of it. They want to peel back the layers and find out what something is really all about or what is causing the
               problem. No more beating around the bush![0m
