[91m        SHORT  A concert is a performance by musicians or singers for an audience. If you're in the glee club, you know about singing in concerts, and maybe you've seen your
               favorite bands in concert, too.[0m
[36m         LONG  A concert usually doesn't involve theatrical staging. You can have a concert version of an opera, but that means the singers stand there and sing without sets
               or props, and without much acting or moving around. Less commonly, concert is a verb (accent on the second syllable), meaning to agree with
               others on something. That meaning shows up in the phrase in concert ‚Äî your objections will carry more weight if you act in concert with your
               neighbors.[0m
