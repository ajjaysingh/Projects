[91m        SHORT  If you got a commendation for your brave deeds during the earthquake, then congratulations! A commendation is an award praising someone‚Äôs actions.[0m
[36m         LONG  A commendation can be an official award for notable action, often given out by a government or other group. A police officer might receive a special
               commendation for being particularly brave. This kind of commendation is often awarded at a public ceremony. You can also use commendation more
               broadly to mean "praise," even if it's not official. It'd be nice to tell your teacher she deserves commendation for the good-natured way she
               has handled your rowdy class all year.[0m
