[91m        SHORT  The word complacency is often hurled, in a rather scornful manner, at people who are unwilling to be political. It connotes a sense of ease and contentment
               with the status quo.[0m
[36m         LONG  It is a rare thing to hear the word complacency used in a purely positive way; there's always a sense of scolding to it. At best it's used to convey a
               person's satisfaction: "Oh? No one asked you to the prom? I've been asked three times," she said with smiling complacency. More usually,
               however, it takes on a political tone, as with large bodies of people who are unwilling to protest corruption because it doesn't touch them:
               "He preached and argued, but it was impossible to jostle the students from their complacency."[0m
