[91m        SHORT  If you go on a crusade against vegetables, you are waging a long-term battle against leafy greens. A crusade is a passionate struggle against something or
               someone.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the 11th through 13th centuries, Roman Catholics attempting to win control of parts of what they considered the Holy Land (currently Israeli, Jordanian,
               Lebanese, and Palestinian lands) waged military battles against the Muslims who controlled the land. These battles are called the Crusades. The
               word crusade carries with it the feeling of a violent and vigorous fight. So if someone is on a crusade to do something, they mean business![0m
