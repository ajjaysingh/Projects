[91m        SHORT  A clementine is a small, orange, seedless citrus fruit. Clementines are usually easy to peel and section, and they taste very sweet.[0m
[36m         LONG  Clementines are a deep orange-colored hybrid fruit, a combination of the mandarin and the sweet orange, similar in size to a tangerine. The history of the
               clementine includes what was probably an accidental invention, and an introduction to California in 1914. The inadvertent inventor of the
               clementine was Father Clément Rodier, who ran an Algerian orphanage, and for whom the fruit was named.[0m
