[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre making a list of all your teachers in the order you had them, from kindergarten right up to the present, you‚Äôre listing them in chronological order.
               Chronological is the order in which things actually happened.[0m
[36m         LONG  Chronological doesn‚Äôt allow for time traveling or flashbacks. If you‚Äôre making a documentary of events leading up to World War II and you start in the early
               1900s and end at the outbreak of the war, in 1939, that‚Äôs chronological.  Reverse chronological order means giving the most recent event first,
               and going backwards from there. Chronological includes the useful Greek root khronos, "time."[0m
