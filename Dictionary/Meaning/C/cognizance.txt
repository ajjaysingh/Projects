                                                                                    COGNIZANCE                                                                                    
  SHORT        When you have cognizance, you have knowledge of something. Your cognizance of the English language is growing with every new vocabulary word you learn. Just
               don't flaunt your cognizance too much, or your friends might call you a "know-it-all."
  LONG         Cognizance can be used to refer to more than just school-based learning (like vocabulary words). It can also mean that you have awareness, or notice certain
               things. Your cognizance of where the exits are located in the movie theater could save your life in a fire. The noun cognizance can also refer
               to your state of consciousness: "You passed out from the smoke, but when you woke up you had the cognizance to know who you were and where you
               were."

     >         There's a mental requirement to have this involuntary downswing: There has to be a cognizance of the target before the shot begins.
     >         The Commission team told the politicians they had "cognizance" of the strength of local feeling about re-drawing the map.
     >         His kindness in a gritty, competitive fashion world made him stand out, as did his deep cognizance of branding, coupled with a technical bravado.
     >         The First Amendment, which takes no cognizance of parties or candidates, hardly supports making them privileged, semi-exclusive conduits of the political
               conversations.
     >         Since the publication of that seminal article, research on this disease has increased dramatically, as has the medical communityâ€™s cognizance of this
               condition.
