[91m        SHORT  When someone hires a friend to do a job, whether or not she's the best candidate, that's cronyism. A governor appointing his inexperienced daughter to an
               important staff position is one example of cronyism.[0m
[36m         LONG  You're most likely to find the word cronyism in political discussions. It's not necessarily considered cronyism for a public figure to hire, promote, or
               appoint her friends or colleagues. However, if the person isn't as qualified as other candidates but gets the job anyway, it's a clear case of
               cronyism. The original meaning of cronyism was simply "friendship," from crony, Cambridge student slang for "old friend" from the Greek
               khronios, "long-lasting."[0m
