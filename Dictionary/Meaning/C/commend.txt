[91m        SHORT  Ever shout "Bravo!" at the end of a ballet or coo "Good boy!" to the dog when he relieved himself outdoors instead of on the rug? Then you know how to commend
               someone â€” in other words, to express approval aloud.[0m
[36m         LONG  The most common meaning of commend is to compliment. You commend someone when you tell them "Well done!" You can even say "I commend you on your hard work."
               Back in the days of Charles Dickens, to commend often meant to put (someone or something) in the hands of someone else for safekeeping. Case in
               point: David Copperfield was out of luck when his cruel stepdad commended him to the equally cruel schoolmaster Mr. Creakle at Salem house.[0m
