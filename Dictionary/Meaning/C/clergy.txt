[91m        SHORT  In the Christian church, the clergy is the entire class of religious officials, from priests to pastors to bishops and beyond. If you have a sense that your

[36m         LONG  Clergy comes from the word clerk, which in turn comes from cleric. If the only clerks you think of are those that work in shoe stores, think of it this way:
               when you join the ministry of a church, the idea is that you serve the church. Clergy is the word for all of the clerics combined, and is
               paired with the laity, which are all the people in the church who aren't in the clergy.[0m
