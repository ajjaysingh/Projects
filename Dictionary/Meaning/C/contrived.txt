[91m        SHORT  If you see something that seems fake since it was too perfectly planned out, call it contrived. If you can easily predict the final minutes of a made-for-TV
               movie, then call it contrived.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective contrived describes something that is artificially planned, especially in an obvious way, so it comes across as faked or forced. It's not just
               drama that can come off as contrived. Someone's speech habits, wardrobe, or even personality can seem contrived. Whenever someone appears as if
               he or she is "trying too hard," they might seem contrived, or the opposite of "natural."[0m
