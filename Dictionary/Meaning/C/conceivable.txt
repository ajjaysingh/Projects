[91m        SHORT  If you see yellowish skies on a humid, spring evening in Kansas, it is entirely conceivable that a tornado is in the making. That is to say, it's imaginable
               or even possible, so make sure you take every conceivable precaution.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you conceive of something, you imagine or think of it. So, it makes sense that the adjective conceivable describes things that can be imagined or thought
               of. People often use the word conceivable in extreme contexts. If you look everywhere for your homework but still can't find it, you might
               declare, "I searched in every conceivable location! My homework must have disappeared." In response, your teacher might remark that
               disappearing homework is inconceivable, or "impossible to imagine."[0m
