[91m        SHORT  The adjective chromatic is useful for describing things related to color, like the beautiful chromatic variation of the sky at sunset.[0m
[36m         LONG  You could describe the chromatic intensity of a fireworks display or the excellent chromatic perception of an artist, who is skilled at seeing nuances of
               color. In physics, the word chromatic has to do with the scientific aspects of color and light. The earliest uses of chromatic, in the 1590s,
               only referred to music, but by the 1800s it was used to mean "color," which is also the meaning of the Greek root, khroma.[0m
