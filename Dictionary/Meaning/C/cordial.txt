[91m        SHORT  If you like someone but you wouldn't say they're your friend, you might describe your relationship as cordial. Use cordial to describe a greeting or
               relationship that is friendly and sincere.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Middle English, this adjective meant "of the heart," borrowed from Medieval Latin cordiƒÅlis, from Latin cor "heart." This core sense of "heart" can be seen
               in the synonyms heartfelt and hearty. The noun cordial originally referred to a medicine or drink that stimulates the heart, but its current
               sense is "a liqueur."[0m
