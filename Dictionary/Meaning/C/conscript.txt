[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre ever drafted into the Turkish army, then you could be called a conscript, someone who is forced to join the military.[0m
[36m         LONG  At the root of conscript is the Latin word conscriptus, meaning ‚Äúenroll.‚Äù Conscript does involve enrollment ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a forced enrollment, used to describe
               someone who has been forced to join the military, such as someone who has been drafted. As a verb, conscript means "force to join," like a
               military that conscripts new soldiers. In contrast, those who choose to join are recruited; when they enter the service, they enlist.[0m
