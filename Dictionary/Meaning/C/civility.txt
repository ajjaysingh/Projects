[91m        SHORT  Civility is the act of showing regard for others by being polite, like the civility you showed in speaking kindly to someone who has hurt your feelings.[0m
[36m         LONG  Civility comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "relating to public life, befitting a citizen," in other words, being friendly and nice to everyone. When
               you show civility, you use kindness and good manners. You are respectful, even if you do not like that person very much. Civility can also mean
               formal politeness, like your behavior at a fancy dinner.[0m
