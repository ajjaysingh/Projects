[36m         LONG  You'll find the word circadian in biology class, or your anatomy and physiology textbook, because it describes a biological process in the human body, as well
               as in other organisms. Your cycle of sleep, for example, happens on a circadian schedule ‚Äî approximately every 24 hours, you become tired
               enough to lie down and close your eyes, a built-in rhythm that's affected somewhat by light. Circadian comes from Latin roots, circa, "about,"
               and diem, "day."[0m
