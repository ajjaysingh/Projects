[91m        SHORT  The verb culminate is used to describe a high point or a climactic stage in a process. For example, the goal of a Major League baseball team is to have their
               season culminate in a World Series victory.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word culminate derives from the Latin word culminatus, the past participle of culminare, which means "to top, to crown." Don‚Äôt be afraid of the Latin:
               it‚Äôs on your side. Knowing the Latin origin can help you remember the meaning of culminate. Use culminate when you are referring to a crowning
               moment or a final conclusion: ‚ÄúI want my experiments combining strawberry jam with burnt toast to culminate in a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.‚Äù[0m
