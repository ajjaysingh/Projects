[91m        SHORT  The noun coast describes the area where the land meets the sea ‚Äî the seashore. When your mom says, "We're going to the coast," pack your bathing suit, because

               also be used figuratively to describe something that's gained without much difficulty. You might coast to victory in the playoffs when your
