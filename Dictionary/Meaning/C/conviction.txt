[36m         LONG  In the legal world, when a judge or jury convicts someone of a crime ‚Äî finding them guilty ‚Äî this is called a conviction. Prosecutors try to get convictions,
               and defense attorneys try to prevent them. Also, convictions are beliefs ‚Äî principles. The United States was founded on many convictions, such
               as the belief in free speech and separation of church and state. When you have a conviction, you're certain of something.[0m
