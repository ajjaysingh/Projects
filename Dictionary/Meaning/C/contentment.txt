[91m        SHORT  Contentment is the state of being happy and satisfied. On Thanksgiving when you think about all you are grateful for, hopefully you feel a sense of
               contentment. If not, have another piece of pie and then you‚Äôll feel contentment.[0m
[36m         LONG  Contentment isn‚Äôt an excited kind of happy, it‚Äôs more like a peaceful ease of mind. It‚Äôs being satisfied with what you have, whatever that is. You might feel
               a sense of contentment knowing you have a cup of hot chocolate and a good movie to look forward to tonight. Or you might experience contentment
               thinking about the vast estate you just purchased in the Hamptons. Whatever is going on in your life, you‚Äôre pleased about it.[0m
