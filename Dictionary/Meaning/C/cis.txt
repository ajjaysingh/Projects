[91m        SHORT  A cistern is an underground tank that holds water.  A long time ago, cistern water was used for drinking, but nowadays developed parts of the world mainly use
               it for watering plants and flushing toilets.[0m

               It would be tough to collect enough water to grow barley and wheat without storing the water in something, especially in a place as dry as the
               Middle East.[0m
