  SHORT        If you think public officials are nothing but a bunch of greedy buffoons, you have a cynical attitude about politics.
  LONG         A cynical person has a bleak outlook about others, always imagining that people are ruled by their worst instincts. H.L. Mencken was famous for saying cynical
               things like, "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public." The original Cynics were ancient Greek
               philosophers who never had a good word to say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means "canine," maybe because all of that sneering
               seemed a little dog-like.

     >         During the cynical, paranoid years of the post-war era, Castro brought the passion of a true believer to the ideological contest between east and west.
     >         As a performer, he has become acidic, cynical and cruel.
     >         “Kind of appropriate, but also kind of cynical,” he says finally.
     >         As Lily Tomlin once famously noted, “No matter how cynical you become, it’s never enough to keep up.”
