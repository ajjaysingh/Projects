[36m         LONG  A cynical person has a bleak outlook about others, always imagining that people are ruled by their worst instincts. H.L. Mencken was famous for saying cynical
               things like, "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public." The original Cynics were ancient Greek
               philosophers who never had a good word to say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means "canine," maybe because all of that sneering
               seemed a little dog-like.[0m
