[91m        SHORT  Your close friend or associate is your comrade. Teenagers often prefer seeing movies with a comrade or two, rather than with their parents.[0m
[36m         LONG  Comrade sometimes refers to a fellow soldier, and it is found in the phrase "comrade-in-arms." Movies about World War II comrades-in-arms often show them
               risking their lives to rescue each other. Comrade is also the form of address for members of the Communist party. If Joseph Stalin and Vladimir
               Lenin ran into other at a party, Stalin would say, "Hello, Comrade Lenin!" The root is the Latin camera, or vaulted room, and originally
               comrade meant someone who shares a room.[0m
