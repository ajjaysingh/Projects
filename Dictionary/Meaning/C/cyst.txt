[36m         LONG  The word cyst entered English in the 18th century by way of the Latin word cystis, tracing all the way back to the Greek word kustis, meaning ‚Äúbladder.‚Äù Like
               your bladder, a cyst is sort of like a small pouch, one that‚Äôs typically filled with liquid. Unlike the bladder, however, a cyst is closed,
               meaning the liquid can‚Äôt get out. A cyst is often an abnormal formation in the body, so doctors often remove them.[0m
