[91m        SHORT  Chastise is a fancy word for telling someone that something they did was really bad. If you pick your nose, your mom will probably yell at you. If you pick
               your nose in front of the Queen of England, your mom will chastise you.[0m
[36m         LONG  Back in the Middle Ages, chastise used to also come with a beating‚Äì‚Äìthat sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use chastise when they are
               trying to accuse someone else of overreacting. "You're chastising me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's not like the cat died!"[0m
