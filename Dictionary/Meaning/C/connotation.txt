[91m        SHORT  When you're talking about the implied subtext of words rather than their literal meaning, reach for the noun connotation. A political boss might not want to

[36m         LONG  From the Latin com- "with" + notare "to mark," this word is all about reading between the lines. The literal meaning (or denotation) of Wall Street, for
               instance, is "a street in lower Manhattan that's home to many financial institutions," but the same phrase's connotations may include "wealth,"
               "power," or "greed," depending on your experiences and opinions. A closely related word is implication.[0m
