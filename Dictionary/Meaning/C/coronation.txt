[36m         LONG  A coronation is the public handing over of title and powers to a new monarch. Other almost identical terms are enthronement and investiture. The term
               coronation is also sometimes used in a light-hearted, though sometimes sarcastic way, to describe the ascension of famous non-royal people who
               have achieved a particular level of public status ‚Äî such as pop stars, politicians or celebrities. Coronation is derived from the Latin word
               corona, meaning "crown."[0m
