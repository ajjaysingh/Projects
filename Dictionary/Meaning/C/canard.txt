[91m        SHORT  During a political campaign, you will often hear on TV commercials some canard about the opponent. This is a false, deluding statement designed to confuse the
               voters, as it presents the other candidate in a bad light by spreading an untruth.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Old French word quanart, "duck," morphed into canard, as in "vendre un canard à moitié," which refers to "half-selling" a duck, or cheating someone, and
               the word came to mean something meant to fool someone deliberately. Poet James Whitcomb Riley said, "When I see a bird that walks like a duck
               and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck." Not always the case with canard.[0m
