[91m        SHORT  In a crescendo, the music is getting louder. There's often a crescendo in a large group of talking people, too.[0m
[36m         LONG  This word comes from classical music, where it's very important how loudly the instruments play. If a tuba is crescendoing at the wrong time, then a quiet
               piano part might not be heard at all. The crescendo is important in all kinds of music, because volume ‚Äî how loud something is ‚Äî is one of the
               main features of music. If you are whispering and gradually raise your voice and then end up shouting, that's a crescendo as well.[0m
