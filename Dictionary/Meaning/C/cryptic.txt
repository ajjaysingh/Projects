[91m        SHORT  "White bunny. Moon. Square." Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic. Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand
               because they seem to have a hidden meaning.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cryptic is from Late Latin crypticus, from Greek kryptikos, from kryptos "hidden." This Greek adjective is the source of our English word crypt, referring to
               a room under a church in which dead people are buried. That might account for why the word cryptic has an eerie tone to it.[0m
