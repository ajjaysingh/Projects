[91m        SHORT  To clutch is to grasp or hold on to tightly. Some people clutch the safety bar on the roller coaster for dear life; others throw their hands in the air.[0m

               describe grasping. "Once I knew only darkness and stillness . . . but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched
               at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living,‚Äù said Helen Keller, recalling the moment she learned to read Braille.[0m
