                                                                                      COGENT                                                                                      
  SHORT        When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations
               of complex government policy, it’s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.
  LONG         Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build
               a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool…well that’s not a cogent argument; it’s just
               random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with
               nature.

     >         The show, which cogently lays out the history of art made in the wake of the Mexican Revolution, is “sprawling” and “thrilling.”
     >         But the story of Mexican art during and after the Revolution is cogently laid out in five sections.
     >         An astonishingly assured blend of genres, experiences and disparate narrative forces into one cogent and moving experience.
     >         Still remarkably fit and cogent at his advanced age, Robinson said the key to his longevity has been “a good wife.”
     >         How that changed is the story filmmakers Mitchell and Louvel cogently tell.
