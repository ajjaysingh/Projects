[91m        SHORT  When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations
               of complex government policy, it‚Äôs hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build
               a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool‚Ä¶well that‚Äôs not a cogent argument; it‚Äôs just
               random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with
               nature.[0m
