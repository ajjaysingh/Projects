[91m        SHORT  A crony (rhymes with ‚Äúpony‚Äù) is a buddy, a close confidant you spend time with and trust. Your boss might make everyone at work angry if she keeps only giving
               raises to her cronies.[0m
[36m         LONG  While a crony is basically just a good pal or sidekick, the word sometimes has a negative connotation ‚Äî that you and your crony are up to no good together. It
               also implies the idea of cronyism, or unfairly giving friends jobs or promotions they're not qualified for.  Crony capitalism refers to doing
               that in an economic way, like people in government giving tax breaks to their friends. Crony is 17th century British student slang, from the
               Greek khronios, "long-lasting."[0m
