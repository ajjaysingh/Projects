[91m        SHORT  The word comprehension means understanding. When you lack comprehension of a difficult word, you will likely need to look up its definition and usage in a

[36m         LONG  Comprehension actually comes from the Latin term, comprehensionem, which means "a seizing." When you have comprehension of a subject, you have seized
               information and incorporated it into your own knowledge. Any kind of mental grasping of an idea or a subject is a kind of comprehension. You
               might attempt comprehension of a curious situation, like the fact that your goofy roommate always manages to date models. Sometimes, such
               mysteries are beyond comprehension![0m
