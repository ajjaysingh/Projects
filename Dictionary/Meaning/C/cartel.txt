[91m        SHORT  When groups band together to control the supply of a product for their best interests, that‚Äôs called a cartel. If you and the other kids running lemonade
               stands form a cartel, you can force up the price of lemonade.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word cartel originally referred to political parties that joined forces to promote a common cause. Over the years, cartel took on a decidedly negative
               connotation, and now it‚Äôs more likely to describe organizations that join together to limit supply of a product to force prices to remain high.
               You might read about an international drug cartel or a cartel of natural gas producers. To correctly pronounce the word cartel, put the accent
               on the second syllable: ‚Äúcar TEL.‚Äù[0m
