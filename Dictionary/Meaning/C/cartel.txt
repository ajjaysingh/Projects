  SHORT        When groups band together to control the supply of a product for their best interests, that’s called a cartel. If you and the other kids running lemonade
               stands form a cartel, you can force up the price of lemonade.
  LONG         The word cartel originally referred to political parties that joined forces to promote a common cause. Over the years, cartel took on a decidedly negative
               connotation, and now it’s more likely to describe organizations that join together to limit supply of a product to force prices to remain high.
               You might read about an international drug cartel or a cartel of natural gas producers. To correctly pronounce the word cartel, put the accent
               on the second syllable: “car TEL.”

     >         ANALYST’S TAKE: The latest developments suggest “cartel members may fail to agree on production cuts,” said Nicholas Teo of KGI in a report.
     >         He also says drug cartel scouts engage with officers and troopers on border highways as decoys.
     >         Iraq and Iran, OPEC’s second- and third-largest producers, have yet to agree on a detailed plan to reduce output discussed by the cartel.
     >         Mr Galan, who had vowed to extradite cartel leaders to the US, was considered the leading candidate for Colombia's 1990 election.
     >         Mexican authorities have discovered 32 bodies and nine heads hidden in mass graves in a region plagued by violence from drug cartels.
