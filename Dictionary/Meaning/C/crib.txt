[91m        SHORT  A crib is a bed with high sides that babies sleep in. To crib is to cheat, like copying off someone else during an exam. How babyish![0m
[36m         LONG  A crib is a small, cozy bed that has high sides known as slats. The slats keep the baby from falling out. To crib is different â€” it means to cheat, especially
               by copying or stealing information. If you stole an answer key to a test, you cribbed it. If you friend told you the answers to some homework,
               you cribbed the answers. Cribbing is dishonest.[0m
