[91m        SHORT  A conformist is a person who follows traditional standards of conduct. If you're a conformist, it's unlikely you'll join a revolution to overthrow your
               government; instead you'll argue that it's best to keep things the way they are.[0m
[36m         LONG  Conformist comes from the Old French word conformer, which means "to agree to, make or be similar, be agreeable." People sometimes use the term conformist in
               a negative way, as an insult implying that someone doesn't have the brains or the guts to question the status quo. Conformist can also be used
               as an adjective to describe something that follows convention and established customs. A conformist school board, for example, would follow the
               usual time-tested curriculum.[0m
