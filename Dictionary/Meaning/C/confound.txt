[91m        SHORT  If you have an identical twin, you've probably tried dressing alike so that people confound you with, or mistake you for, one another. You've also probably
               learned that, unfortunately, this trick doesn‚Äôt work on your mom.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb confound means both "to mistake" and "to confuse." If you decide to treat yourself to a delicious dessert, you might find yourself confounded by the
               overwhelming number of choices. If you end up ordering the chocolate cake but the waiter brings you chocolate mousse, the waiter has somehow
               confounded those two options. Another meaning you may come across in literature is "to damn," as in "Confound it! You are the most exasperating
               person on the planet."[0m
