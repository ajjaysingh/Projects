[36m         LONG  This adjective is usually followed by the preposition to, and it refers to bringing about something favorable or helpful: A positive attitude is conducive to
               good health. Conducive was formed in English from the less common verb conduce "to lead or contribute to a result." The verb conduce descends
               from Middle English conducen, from Latin conducere, from the prefix com- "together" plus ducere "to lead." And the suffix ‚Äìive means "tending
               to."[0m
