[91m        SHORT  A cabinet is a piece of furniture that has doors and drawers and is often used for storage, like a kitchen cabinet that holds your drinking glasses and
               plates.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cabinets store things, like a bathroom cabinet that holds items like toothbrushes and soap. Another kind of cabinet is a group of official advisers of
               executive departments of governments. President Andrew Jackson had a group of informal advisers whom his opponents mockingly called his
               "kitchen cabinet," a term which has since lost its negative meaning and describes any President's closest confidantes.[0m
