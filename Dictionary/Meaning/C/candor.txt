[91m        SHORT  Candor usually means the quality of being open, honest, and sincere. If someone tells you they think you are dumb, you might reply with, "While I appreciate
               your candor, I don't think we need to be friends anymore."[0m
[36m         LONG  The corresponding adjective is candid, as in "I want you to be candid. Do these pants make me look fat?" Candor is from French candeur, from Latin candor,
               from candēre "to shine, be white." The color white is associated with purity, which is a now obsolete meaning of candor.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English (in the Latin sense): from Latin candor ‘whiteness’. The current sense dates from the mid 18th century; the development of the senses
               paralleled that of candid.
