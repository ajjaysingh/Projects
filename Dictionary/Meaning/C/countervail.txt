[36m         LONG  To countervail is to counteract, counterbalance, or neutralize. This verb is best known to us in the form of its participle countervailing, which gets far
               more time in the limelight as an adjective than countervail gets as a verb. A favorite combo these days is countervailing duty, a duty imposed
               on imports to match (or retaliate for) what a foreign government is imposing. You could say a running back was countervailed if a defensive
               player stops him in his tracks.[0m
