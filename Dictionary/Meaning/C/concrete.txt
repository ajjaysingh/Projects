[91m        SHORT  Concrete is that pourable mix of cement, water, sand, and gravel that hardens into a super-strong building material. Sidewalks, foundations, and highways are
               all made of concrete.[0m
[36m         LONG  Though people use the words cement and concrete as if they were the same, they're not. Concrete has cement in it, but also includes other materials; cement is
               what binds concrete together. Construction workers hate when kids write their names in concrete before it hardens: once concrete hardens, it's
               going to be solid for a long time. When used as an adjective, concrete also means solid. If you've got concrete plans for Saturday, then you
               have a definite plan.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English (in the sense ‚Äòsolidified‚Äô): from French concret or Latin concretus, past participle of concrescere ‚Äògrow together‚Äô. Early use was also as
               a grammatical term designating a quality belonging to a substance (usually expressed by an adjective such as white in white paper ) as opposed
               to the quality itself (expressed by an abstract noun such as whiteness ); later concrete came to be used to refer to nouns embodying attributes
               (e.g. fool, hero ), as opposed to the attributes themselves (e.g. foolishness, heroism ), and this is the basis of the modern use as the
               opposite of ‚Äòabstract‚Äô. The noun sense ‚Äòbuilding material‚Äô dates from the mid 19th century.
