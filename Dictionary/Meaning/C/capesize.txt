[91m        SHORT  To capsize is to overturn, and it usually happens to boats. Don't rock the boat, baby, or you might just capsize.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a boat tips over in a lake, it capsizes, and so does a boy who is sitting on an inner tube when it flips suddenly. Anything overturning in a body of
               water can be said to capsize. Sometimes vessels that capsize can be righted, like a canoe, and other times they sink to the bottom of the sea.
               The origin of capsize is uncertain, though it may be related to the Spanish word capuzar, "sink by the head."[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Capesize  ships are the largest dry cargo ships. They are too large to transit the Suez Canal (Suezmax limits) or Panama Canal (Neopanamax limits), and so
               have to pass either Cape Agulhas or Cape Horn to traverse between oceans.
