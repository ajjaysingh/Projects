[91m        SHORT  A colonnade is a row of tall columns that support a building or a roof. You might see a colonnade at the front of a museum.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ancient Greek and Roman buildings were often designed with a colonnade supporting them, and classically designed buildings still sometimes include a
               colonnade. Washington DC's Lincoln Memorial is fronted by a colonnade, and even ordinary libraries, post offices, and museums might have them.
               The word was first used in the 1700's, and it comes from the French colonnade,  with its Latin root of columna, or "pillar."[0m
