                                                                                     CONSTRUE                                                                                     
  SHORT        If you interpret something or make sense of it, you construe its meaning. If the new girl in your class asks to sit with you at lunch, you could construe that
               she wants to be friends. You can never have too many friends!
  LONG         To make an assumption based on evidence is to construe. You could construe that eating an entire box of cookies might make you feel a bit sick. And you might
               not want to eat them again for a very long time. The opposite of construe is misconstrue, which means to falsely or wrongly interpret. If you
               get a poor grade on an essay, you shouldn't construe that your teacher dislikes you. If you do, you misconstrue your work for his feelings.

     >         His child-care tax breaks, as currently construed, would primarily benefit the wealthy.
     >         “Likewise, rhetorical hyperbole might appear to make an assertion, but a reasonable reader or listener would not construe that assertion seriously.”
     >         Residents of the city, from government officials to shopkeepers, are uniformly reluctant to be quoted by name, lest any statement be construed as public
               criticism.
     >         The history of science, broadly construed, must shoulder some of the blame.
     >         We pride ourselves on being realists, but in fact we have a fatal weakness for construing the world as crude morality plays.
