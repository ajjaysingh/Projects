[91m        SHORT  Consecrate means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to consecrate a building to turn it into a church, but you can also consecrate a
               week in New York City to the pursuit of the perfect bagel.[0m
[36m         LONG  The secr part of consecrate comes from the Latin sacer "sacred." Remember that something consecrated is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember
               that the meanings of words tend to stretch; over time this one moved from "dedicated to God" to "dedicated to whatever": jelly donuts, the
               perfect tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube.[0m
