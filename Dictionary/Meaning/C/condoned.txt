[36m         LONG  Things that are condoned are allowed, even if everyone isn't exactly thrilled about it. People often say, "I don't condone what he did, but I understand it."

               "I don't condone you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read." That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same
               time.[0m
