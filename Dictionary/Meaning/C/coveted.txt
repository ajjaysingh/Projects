[91m        SHORT  Coveted means "in demand" or "desired." If the most coveted seat on the bus for you is the one right next to the bathroom, then you shouldn‚Äôt have any problem

[36m         LONG  Coveted comes from the Latin cupiditas, meaning ‚Äúpassionate desire, eagerness, ambition.‚Äù Cupid isn't always involved, though ‚Äî coveted is another way of
               saying "sought after." The poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox said, ‚ÄúIf you are seeking health, wealth, usefulness, skill in any direction, there is
               nothing and no one who can hinder your attainment of the coveted boon, if you are willing to work and wait." So get to work for all that
               coveted health and wealth![0m
