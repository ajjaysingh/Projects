[91m        SHORT  Censure is a noun referring to very strong criticism; the verb means to criticize very strongly. If you take your dad's car without telling him, you can
               expect him to censure you severely, and maybe even ground you as well.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun and verb are most closely associated with official expressions of disapproval, as when Congress censures a senator. The noun is from Latin cƒìns≈´ra
               "censorship," from cƒìnsor "an ancient Roman censor." The job of a Roman censor was to take the census and to supervise public morals and
               behavior. Our English word censor‚Äì‚Äìwhich means to suppress speech or other forms of expression‚Äì‚Äìis from this Latin word.[0m
