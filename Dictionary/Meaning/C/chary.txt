[91m        SHORT  Being chary (pronounced CHAIR-ee) is being wary or cautious. If you lost two teeth in last year‚Äôs rugby season, you should be chary of signing up again this

[36m         LONG  Chary comes from the Old English word cearig for "sorrowful, careful," which is basically what you are if you‚Äôre chary. If you‚Äôre a little suspicious of
               something and mulling it over, you‚Äôre being chary. A synonym of chary is wary, and both include caution, but some definitions suggest that it's
               obvious when someone is wary ‚Äî it shows ‚Äî while being chary is more of an inside, or hidden, distrust.[0m
