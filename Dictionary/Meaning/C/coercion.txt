[91m        SHORT  Coercion is making something happen by force, like when bullies use coercion to make kids give them their lunch money.[0m
[36m         LONG  Coercion can be a threat, "The shady lawyer uses coercion when he threatens to get the waiter fired if he doesn't rat out his boss," or it can be actual brute
               force, as when the gangster breaks the messenger's leg to keep her from talking to the police. The police might use coercion, too, to get a
               confession. The prefix co- is derived from the Latin word for "together." So you can't use coercion on yourself; you need someone else to force
               into doing something.[0m
