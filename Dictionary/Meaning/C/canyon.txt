[36m         LONG  The noun canyon refers to a deep ravine that has been cut into the earth's surface over a long period of time by erosion from a running river. Also known as a
               gorge, it usually has very steep walls with rocky cliffs. One of the most famous examples is the Grand Canyon, which was cut by the Colorado
               River. It's an astounding 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and a mile deep.[0m
