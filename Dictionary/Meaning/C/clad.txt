[91m        SHORT  Clad means dressed or covered. You might be clad in green velvet and leather. A jewelry box might be clad in ebony with silver carvings.[0m
[36m         LONG  As it applies to what a person is wearing, clad is the past participle of clothe. If you wanted to talk about the day your friend commanded you to clothe
               yourself in green and you obeyed, you'd say, "I clad myself in green." Of course, it sounds archaic. Like talking about your shoes by saying
               shod.[0m
