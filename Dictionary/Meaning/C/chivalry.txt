[91m        SHORT  Men behaving courteously toward women ‚Äî holding the door for them, offering them their jackets when it's cold ‚Äî is called chivalry. Many women consider
               chivalry a lost art.  Nice work, fellas.[0m
[36m         LONG  Cavalry (soldiers on horseback) and chivalry have the same root: the Medieval Latin word caballarius, meaning "horseman" or "knight." In the Middle Ages, a
               knight was expected to be brave, loyal, and to open the tavern door for his date. Picture a knight kneeling before a maiden and kissing her
               hand. It's a classic image of chivalry from the storybooks. Some women wonder whether chivalry has ever existed anywhere else.[0m
