[91m        SHORT  A chortle is a joyful, partly muffled laugh. If you have a toddler, you will recognize the sound of a delighted chortle, sort of louder and a bit more raucous
               than a giggle.[0m
[36m         LONG  In 1871, Lewis Carroll, who wrote "Alice in Wonderland," coined the word chortle in the poem "Jabberwocky," about a son who slays a monster and comes back to
               his relieved and happy father: "'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy." Experts consider the word a blend of the words
               chuckle and snort and the laugh itself is also a cross between the two. You may chortle in glee if you find out your work nemesis just got a
               new job in another office ‚Äî out of state.[0m
