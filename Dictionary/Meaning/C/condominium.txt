[36m         LONG  A condominium is split into units, which can be apartments, floors of houses, or even entire houses ‚Äî each of these units is also a condominium. Rather than
               renting from a landlord, the way you do with an apartment, each occupant owns his or her individual condominium, and they all contribute money
               each month for maintenance and upkeep. The Modern Latin meaning of condominium is "joint rule or sovereignty," combining com-, "together," and
               dominum, "right of ownership."[0m
