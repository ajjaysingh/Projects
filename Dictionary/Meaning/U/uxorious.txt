[91m        SHORT  A man who dotes on or really adores his wife is uxorious. Your uxorious grandfather, for example, might plan your grandmother's surprise birthday party months
               in advance.[0m
[36m         LONG  Uxorious goes back to the Latin root ≈´xor, "wife," and it came into English in the 16th century. Uxorious is usually negative, a way to show that a husband
               has too much concern for his wife or is submissive to her desires. It's also an increasingly dated, old fashioned word, as a husband is
               considered uxorious if he lets his wife "control" him. There's no corresponding adjective you can use of a wife "controlled" by her husband.[0m
