[91m        SHORT  Someone who's unwary isn't careful ‚Äî in fact, an unwary person might be a little bit reckless. When your unwary cousin travels to China, he might end up being

[36m         LONG  When you don't know the potential dangers or challenges that lie in front of you, you're unwary. While unwary people aren't overly suspicious or cautious,
               they run the risk of being taken advantage of or even getting hurt. To be wary is to be very watchful or cautious ‚Äî it comes from the Old
               English root w√¶r, "prudent, aware, or alert," and unwary combines it with un, or "not."[0m
