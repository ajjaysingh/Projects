               unrequited love.[0m
[36m         LONG  Unrequited love is so painful, most people feel they are the first person in history to experience it, but the word unrequited has in fact been around since
               the 1520s, when it was invented, like many good words, to talk about money. It derived from re- 'back' + the Middle English quite 'pay up.'[0m
