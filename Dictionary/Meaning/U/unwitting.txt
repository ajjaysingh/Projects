[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective unwitting to describe someone who doesn't know certain important information, such as unwitting computer users who don't know that an online

[36m         LONG  Unwitting can also describe something you do almost automatically, like the unwitting way you double-check that the door is locked when leaving the house. It
               can also indicate that something is done without intention, like an unwitting arrival at a by-invitation-only event. Wit means "clever," so
               something that is unwitting is not clever.[0m
