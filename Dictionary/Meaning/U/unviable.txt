[36m         LONG  Enviable things are so desirable that everybody wants them. A high-paying job is enviable. A vacation in the Caribbean is enviable. Winning the lottery is
               very enviable. Anytime someone does something impressive or buys something cool, it's likely to be described with the word enviable. Also, a
               sports team with a big lead could be described as being in an enviable position: other teams would like to be in their position.[0m
