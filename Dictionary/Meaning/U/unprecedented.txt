[91m        SHORT  Something that is unprecedented is not known, experienced, or done before. If you've never gone on a family beach vacation but you're planning one now, you
               could refer to it as an unprecedented decision.[0m
[36m         LONG  The root of this word is precedent, a noun referring to something done or said that is used as an example to be followed in the future. In law, a precedent is
               a legal decision that is used as a standard in future cases. So the adjective unprecedented, meaning "having no precedent," was formed from the
               prefix un- "not," the noun precedent, and the suffix ‚Äìed "having."[0m
