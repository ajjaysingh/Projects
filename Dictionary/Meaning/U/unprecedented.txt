                                                                                  UNPRECEDENTED                                                                                   
  SHORT        Something that is unprecedented is not known, experienced, or done before. If you've never gone on a family beach vacation but you're planning one now, you
               could refer to it as an unprecedented decision.
  LONG         The root of this word is precedent, a noun referring to something done or said that is used as an example to be followed in the future. In law, a precedent is
               a legal decision that is used as a standard in future cases. So the adjective unprecedented, meaning "having no precedent," was formed from the
               prefix un- "not," the noun precedent, and the suffix –ed "having."
