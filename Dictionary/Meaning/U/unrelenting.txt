[91m        SHORT  Unrelenting is an adjective that describes someone or something that is not willing to give up, like a person who tries fifty different types of ice cream in

[36m         LONG  The word unrelenting usually describes a person who is stubborn and persistent in his efforts. An unrelenting person may also be unforgiving, such as a judge

               that kept you awake all night.[0m
