[91m        SHORT  Something unsolicited was not asked for and possibly not wanted. Unsolicited calls and advice come whether we want them or not.[0m
[36m         LONG  One very common use of this word is in discussing "unsolicited advice" or feedback, which definitely has a negative spin. If someone is butting into your
               business, telling you what you should do, they're giving unsolicited advice. Junk mail is unsolicited. Phone calls trying to sell you something
               are unsolicited. Unsolicited seems negative, but it can be used positively. If you give compliments that are unsolicited, then you offer them
               spontaneously and honestly ‚Äî that's something people like.[0m
