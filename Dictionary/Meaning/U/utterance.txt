                                                                                    UTTERANCE                                                                                     
  SHORT        An utterance is a bit of spoken language. It could be anything from "Ugh!" to a full sentence.
  LONG         To utter means "to say." So when you're saying something, you're making utterances. Saying "24" in math class is an utterance. A police officer yelling
               "Stop!" is an utterance. Saying "Good boy!" to your dog is an utterance. Even a long speech by the President is an utterance. If you can't hear
               it, it's not an utterance.

     >         They say that they hope for the best, that Trump’s most outlandish campaign trail utterances will fade as he moves on to new responsibilities.
     >         It certainly was difficult to find the coherency in Trump’s utterances over the past 18 months.
     >         Now it’s over, and like with any great tabloid divorce, we’re now left to read the tea leaves of their every movement and utterance.
     >         Those things are present only by implication, or in the joyous utterances of his less inhibited fans.
     >         “Trump’s every utterance, no matter how innocuous, is now parsed, analyzed and criticized by a litany of political pundits,” the letter continued.
