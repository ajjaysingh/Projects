[91m        SHORT  When someone takes umbrage at something, they find it offensive, and it probably makes them angry.[0m
[36m         LONG  Umbrage comes from the same source as umbrella, the Latin umbra, "shade, shadow." The umbrella was invented to keep you in shade, and when you take umbrage at
               something, you're casting a shadow over the person or thing responsible for the offense. I take umbrage at the suggestion that I'm not a nice
               person: it's offensive and infuriating. After having devoted my life to helping animals, I might take umbrage at the notion that I've been
               doing it for publicity purposes: I resent the idea that it was for any other reason than my love of animals.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English (in sense 2): from Old French, from Latin umbra â€˜shadowâ€™. An early sense was â€˜shadowy outlineâ€™, giving rise to â€˜ground for suspicionâ€™,
               whence the current notion of â€˜offenceâ€™.
