[91m        SHORT  Something that's unswerving follows a direct path. Because an unswerving person or thing never turns aside, the word is also commonly used to describe
               steadfast loyalty, like a dog's unswerving devotion to its master.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective unswerving often describes loyalty. Your best friend's unswerving loyalty to you, for example, feels secure and dependable — you know she'll
               always be there for you. You can also use the word more literally, when you talk about something moving in a straight, unswerving line, never
               making a turn or detour. The verb swerve is at the root of unswerving — originally, it meant "to depart," but by the fourteenth century its
               meaning was "to deviate from a straight course."[0m
