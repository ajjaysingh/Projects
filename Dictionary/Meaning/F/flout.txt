[36m         LONG  Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle
               English flowten ‚Äúto play the flute." As a verb, it means to scorn, as in, for example, to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it. As
               a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, ‚ÄúFlout 'em, and scout 'em; and scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is
