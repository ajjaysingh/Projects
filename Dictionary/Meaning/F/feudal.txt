  SHORT        Anything feudal relates to the medieval system of feudalism — where the nobility owned the land while everyone else worked it. It was no fun to be a lowly
               serf in the feudal system.
  LONG         Though it has roots in Latin, the adjective feudal (and its relative feudalism) were created by historians to describe the social system after it actually
               took place. Feudal may both look and sound similar to feud as in a long standing fight, but it’s not actually related — unless the argument
               happened to take place in medieval Europe.
