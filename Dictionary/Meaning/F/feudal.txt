[91m        SHORT  Anything feudal relates to the medieval system of feudalism ‚Äî where the nobility owned the land while everyone else worked it. It was no fun to be a lowly

               took place. Feudal may both look and sound similar to feud as in a long standing fight, but it‚Äôs not actually related ‚Äî unless the argument
               happened to take place in medieval Europe.[0m
