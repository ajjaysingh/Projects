[91m        SHORT  A fleece is a sheep's coat.  Or a goat's. Or a yak's. A person's coat can be called a fleece, too, if it comes from a sheep or goat or a yak or even if it
               just looks like it did.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can also use fleece in an informal way to mean cheating someone.  Remember how Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow?  Well, it was such a
               nice, clean fleece that Mary tricked the lamb into trusting her, then robbed him of his fleece and turned it into a bomber jacket and a pair of
               boots. She totally fleeced him![0m
