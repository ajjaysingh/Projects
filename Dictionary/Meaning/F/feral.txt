[91m        SHORT  When animal control finds a feral dog, they have to handle it very carefully because the animal is so wild that it's probably afraid of humans and likely to

[36m         LONG  Feral is often used to describe a wild, untamed animal, like the feral cat with its claws and sharp teeth menacingly bared, ready to strike. Qualities that
               are similar to a wild animal can also be called feral. The child who grew alone up in a cabin in the woods, and who didn't go to school, was
               called feral when she ran away from the orphanage.[0m
