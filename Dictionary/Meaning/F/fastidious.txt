[91m        SHORT  If you want to describe a person who insists on perfection or pays much attention to food, clothing and cleanliness, the right word is fastidious.[0m
[36m         LONG  Fastidious is a funny-sounding adjective from the Latin fastidium "loathing" that has several equally strange-sounding synonyms ‚Äî persnickety, fussbudgety,
               finicky and punctilious. Fussy and hard to please will also do the trick. Fastidious is occasionally used as a compliment to describe someone
               whose attention to detail gives them good organizing abilities, but it is usually used as a disapproving term.[0m
