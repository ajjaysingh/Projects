[91m        SHORT  To forsake another person is to leave them entirely, usually in a moment of need.[0m
[36m         LONG  Forsake may mean simply giving something up, such as a way of life or a homeland, for something better or more appropriate. But it is often a mean word,
               suggesting leaving something or someone behind when they need you to stay. One way to remember the meaning of this verb ‚Äî to abandon or desert
               ‚Äî is to remember this little sentence: "For heaven's sake, don't leave me, or heaven is lost!" Lose the heaven, and you have forsake.[0m
