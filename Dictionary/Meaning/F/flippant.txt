[91m        SHORT  When a parent scolds a teenager for missing a curfew or blowing off a test and the teen snaps back, "Whatever," you could say the teen is being flippant. His
               reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.[0m
[36m         LONG  When it first showed up in the English language around the 17th century, flippant meant glib and talkative. But over the years it has developed a more
               negative connotation. Today flippant is used to describe a blasé attitude or comment in a situation that calls for seriousness. Make a flippant
               comment about your friend's mother and the odds are good that they'll be offended.[0m

      Origin:  early 17th century: from flip1 + -ant, perhaps on the pattern of heraldic terms such as couchant and rampant . Early senses included ‘nimble’ and ‘talkative’,
               hence ‘playful’, giving rise to the current use ‘lacking seriousness’.
