[91m        SHORT  The adjective frenetic is another way to say frenzied, frantic, or totally worked up. Kind of how you'd run around the kitchen madly trying to cook a last-
               minute dinner for 30 of your closest friends.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sometimes tinged with fear and often quite maniacal, frenetic comes from the Latin phreneticus, meaning ‚Äúdelirious.‚Äù The Latin word, in turn, came from a
               similarly spelled Greek word which, when translated literally, means ‚Äúinflammation of the brain.‚Äù So it's no surprise that a frenetic person
               looks absolutely crazed and super anxious.[0m
