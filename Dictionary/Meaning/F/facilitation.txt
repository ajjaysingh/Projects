[91m        SHORT  Use the noun facilitation to describe helping, improving, or making something easier, like the newly widened staircase and hall designed for the facilitation

[36m         LONG  The Latin word for "easy," is facilis. You can see this origin in facilitation, which means "the act of making something easier." If you volunteer to help
               with the facilitation of enrolling new students at a school, you might hand by the door, handing out forms and directing families to the main
               office. You make the new people's experience better, which is another meaning of facilitation, improvement.[0m
