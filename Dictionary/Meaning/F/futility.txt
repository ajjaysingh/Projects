[91m        SHORT  When you can’t see the point in even trying, that’s the feeling of futility, the sense that no matter how much you work at it, nothing good will happen, so
               you might as well give up.[0m
[36m         LONG  What’s the point?  That’s the question asked by anyone who senses the futility of something.  The futility of war makes soldiers put down their weapons, and
               your father’s strict rules makes any protest an act of futility.   The root word is the Latin futilis, which literally means “leaky.”  Imagine
               pouring lemonade into a cup that has no bottom.  No matter how long you pour, you’ll never get a sip because of that leaky cup.  Ah, the
               futility![0m
