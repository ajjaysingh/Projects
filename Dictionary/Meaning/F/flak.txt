  SHORT        If you’re taking flak, chances are you’re in a bad situation and taking fire from an enemy. Flak can refer to criticism — or worse, shots from an airplane.
  LONG         Flak came into English as an abbreviation for the German word Fliegerabwehrkanone, meaning 'aircraft-defense gun.' (Yikes! No wonder they abbreviated it.) If
               you’re dealing with a lot of flak, you’re either in a fighter plane over enemy territory drawing shots, or you’re dealing with a volley of
               criticism that seems like antiaircraft fire. If you show up late for work for a third day, you’ll probably take some flak from your coworkers —
               they’ll take verbal shots at you.

     >         “So, hats off to him. He took some flak this election cycle, so I’m glad he could cash in on it.”
     >         “He said we had gone through the flak and every gunner was shooting except me,” McGuire said.
     >         Those who check in to the War Hostel are greeted by the owner wearing a helmet and a flak jacket.
     >         Kelly has caught flak since for taking so long to out Ailes — a decision she still grapples with.
     >         “The media’s given Billy a lot of flak and I’m pleased Coach James has been sticking up for him,” senior center Ed Cunningham said.
