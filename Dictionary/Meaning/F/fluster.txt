[36m         LONG  If your coworker is about to give the biggest presentation of his life, you‚Äôll probably only fluster, or upset, him if you point out that his socks don‚Äôt
               match. Use the adjective form, flustered, to describe someone when they‚Äôre feeling this way. Most of us get flustered once in a while, but if
               you‚Äôre ‚Äúeasily flustered,‚Äù it happens to you quite often. Don‚Äôt worry, though; that just gives you more opportunities to practice using this
               vocabulary word.[0m
