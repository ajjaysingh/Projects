[36m         LONG  Did you know that most varieties of English are in fact ‚Äúfeck‚Äù-less? They don‚Äôt contain a word feck, only the negative counterpart feckless. The ‚Äúfeck‚Äù in
               feckless began as a short form of effect used in the Scots dialect. So feckless essentially means "ineffective," but is also used to describe
               someone who is irresponsible, incompetent, inept, or without purpose in life.[0m
