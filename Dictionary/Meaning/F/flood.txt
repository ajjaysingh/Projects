[36m         LONG  Whenever it rains and rains and rains, there's the danger of a flood, a type of disaster where water is out of control. Because a flood is so powerful, people
               use the word when overwhelmed by other things. A top college graduate could be flooded with job offers ‚Äî that's a good kind of flood. People
               can also be flooded with emotion. Words with similar meanings are deluge and overflow. Too much ‚Äî or just a lot ‚Äî of anything can seem like a
