[91m        SHORT  Frivolous things are silly or unnecessary. If something is frivolous, then you don't need it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Frivolous things are goofy, useless, or just plain dumb. The word is often used to describe lawsuits. A frivolous lawsuit has no value and will be a waste of
               the court's time, like someone suing McDonald's for making the coffee too hot (which actually happened). If someone is frivolous, that person
               shouldn't be taken seriously because he's always fooling around and never gets anything done. Frivolous is pretty much the opposite of
               essential.[0m
