[91m        SHORT  The person who creates an organization or a company is known as the founder. Founder is also a verb meaning "fail miserably," which is something a company's
               founder hopes the company will never do.[0m
[36m         LONG  As a noun, founder means "the beginner or originator of something." You might talk about the founder of a nation, the founder of club, or the founder of a
               website. As a verb, founder can mean ‚Äústumble,‚Äù like when you trip and fall, but more generally it means "collapse or fall apart." A sports
               team might founder by slumping on a ten-game losing streak; a ship that sinks in a bad storm can be said to have foundered at sea.[0m
