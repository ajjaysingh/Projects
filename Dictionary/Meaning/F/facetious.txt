[91m        SHORT  If someone is being facetious they‚Äôre being playful with an edge. A knock-knock joke isn‚Äôt facetious, but if you call it the most advanced form of comedy,
               you‚Äôre probably being facetious.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word facetious comes from the French fac√©tie for ‚Äújoke,‚Äù and has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to imply ‚Äúfunny and
               witty,‚Äù as in, ‚ÄúOh what a facetious chap!‚Äù But now it has taken on a darker tone, like a joke that‚Äôs not quite appropriate. Whether appreciated
               or not, facetious things are not for real.[0m
