[91m        SHORT  When you foresee something, you predict or realistically envision it happening. Did you foresee your team winning the playoffs, or were you surprised?[0m
[36m         LONG  Think of foresee as тАЬto see before.тАЭ Prophets in literature are able to foresee events that come to pass; in Greek mythology Tiresias is known for his ability
               to foresee the future. But foresee is not always linked to a supernatural sense. Regular people can foresee events by imagining them taking
               place тАФ and sometimes we use this as a way of prevention. If you foresee yourself failing geometry if you donтАЩt study more, you will probably
               hit the books.[0m
