[36m         LONG  Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were stark raving mad.

               shoppers desperately searching for their last few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police were called and everyone
               rushed to get away.[0m
