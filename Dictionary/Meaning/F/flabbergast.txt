[91m        SHORT  To flabbergast is to shock, awe, bowl over. For something to flabbergast you, it ought to leave you sputtering in amazement.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word flabbergast dates back to 1772, but its origin is unknown. Perhaps its creator had in mind both being aghast and the sputtering sound made by people
               who are so amazed, they can barely speak. To flabbergast is to shock, so some events that might flabbergast you include winning the lottery,
               hearing that your best friend and his family moved to Switzerland yesterday without telling you, or getting stuck in a snowstorm in April in
               Texas.[0m
