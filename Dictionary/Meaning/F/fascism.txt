[91m        SHORT  Fascism is a way of ruling that advocates total control of the people. Your parents' rule that you must be home by midnight might seem like fascism, but

[36m         LONG  The word fascism can be hard to spell, so remember that the c comes after the s. Fascism comes from the Latin fascio, meaning ‚Äúbundle, or political group.‚Äù In
               fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle ‚Äî one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force. There‚Äôs no option to
               vote, no chance to impeach a leader, and no freedom to stand up against the governing body.[0m
