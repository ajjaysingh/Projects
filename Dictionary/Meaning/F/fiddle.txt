[91m        SHORT  A fiddle is the same thing as a violin. The instrument, which has strings and is played with a bow, is more likely to be called a fiddle when it's used to
               play traditional or folk tunes, rather than classical music.[0m
[36m         LONG  Fiddle music is typically written for dancing, and it comes from backgrounds as diverse as Scotland, Eastern Europe, and the Cajun and Zydeco traditions from
               Louisiana. To play the fiddle is to fiddle, and when you mess or play around with something, you also fiddle: "Do you have to fiddle with your
               pen while I'm talking?" Someone who's "fit as a fiddle" is in perfect health.[0m

      Origin:  Old English fithele, denoting a violin or similar instrument (originally not an informal or depreciatory term), related to Dutch vedel and German Fiedel,
               based on Latin vitulari ‚Äòcelebrate a festival, be joyful‚Äô, perhaps from Vitula, the name of a Roman goddess of joy and victory. Compare with
               viol.
