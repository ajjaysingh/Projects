[91m        SHORT  Feminism is a movement that advocates equal rights and opportunities for women. If you think that a man and woman doing the exact same job should get equal
               pay, then you believe in one of the basic principles of feminism.[0m
[36m         LONG  When the word feminism first entered English in 1851, it referred simply to being feminine. By 1895, it had taken on its current meaning as a way to describe
               a theory or activity promoting women‚Äôs rights, especially back then, the right to vote. You might be familiar with the wave of feminism that
               took place during the 1970s, when women fought for more opportunities and equal pay.[0m
