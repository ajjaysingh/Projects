[91m        SHORT  Freedom is the state of being entirely free. Many governments claim to guarantee freedom, but often people do not, in fact, have the absolute freedom to act
               or speak without restraint.[0m
[36m         LONG  People in jail long for freedom. People living under an oppressive government also long for freedom. In the United States, people theoretically have "freedom
               of speech": the right to say whatever they‚Äôre moved to say. You‚Äôll notice the word free in freedom. Free comes from the German frei, meaning,
               ‚Äúto love.‚Äù The word friend shares this origin. You can think of freedom as the condition in which you have the choice to love any friend you
               wish.[0m
