[91m        SHORT  Fisticuffs is the act of fighting, or boxing, with bare hands. A heated argument can sometimes end in fisticuffs, with both participants punching wildly at
               each other.[0m
[36m         LONG  If someone says to you, "Let's take this outside and settle it with some fisticuffs," it means you're likely to end up in a street scuffle. This seventeenth
               century word isn't too common these days, but it's a colorful way to say "fistfight." The word's form may imitate handiwork, or it might be
               based on the now-obsolete adjective fisty, "related to the fists," combined with the verb cuff, or "hit."[0m
