[91m        SHORT  Use fawning to describe someone who's over the top in the flattery department. Like a fawning admirer who just won't stop complimenting your looks, showering
               you with gifts and otherwise kissing the ground you walk on.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the Old English f√¶gnian, meaning ‚Äúrejoice, exult, be glad,‚Äù fawning can be both an adjective and a noun form of the verb fawn. Fawning people are often
               trying to win favor with the person being flattered, and it sometimes comes off as sucking up. So do everyone a favor and don't try to boost
               your poor grades by fawning over your professor‚Äôs every word.[0m
