[91m        SHORT  In a frenzy, people go into a state of hysteria. Stay away from hungry sharks or kids at a 16th birthday party when the pizza arrives if you don't want to get
               caught up in a feeding frenzy.[0m
[36m         LONG  Frenzy is derived from the Latin word phreneticus meaning "delirious." If you're in a frenzy, you're certainly delirious. You can be in a frenzy because
               something made you mad, happy, or even just hungry ‚Äî whatever makes you so crazy you're not thinking clearly. Frenzy is often used when talking
               about a group of people (or animals) who get worked up at the same time about the same thing, like sharks near tasty fish or teenagers near
               pizza.[0m
