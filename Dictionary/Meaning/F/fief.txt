[91m        SHORT  Under the feudal system, a fief was a piece of land. This is short for fiefdom.[0m
[36m         LONG  Words that go along with fief are vassal and feudal lord; the lord (kind of like our landlords) owned the fief and the vassal was subject to all of his rules.
               If you were the lord of a fief, your tenant was your servant. If you were to work on someone's farm but were paid nothing, it would be like you
               were working a fief. The word is not used much these days ‚Äî though people still don‚Äôt like landlords much.[0m
