[91m        SHORT  Something that is delicate and fragile can be described as frail. Grandma's favorite vase is probably too frail to use for football practice; some of us have
               learned that the hard way.[0m
[36m         LONG  Frail can also used to describe a person's physical condition: "When I broke my grandmother's vase, she yelled in a voice so loud that it was hard to believe
               it was coming from her small, frail frame." Another way to use frail is in reference to a person's emotional state. As the poet Sylvia Plath
               astutely observed, "How frail the human heart must be."[0m
