[91m        SHORT  Federalism is a system of government in which entities such as states or provinces share power with a national government. The United States government
               functions according to the principles of federalism.[0m
[36m         LONG  The U.S. political system evolved from the philosophy of federalism. Remember The Federalist Papers, the essays written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and
               James Madison between 1787 and 1788, to convince people to approve the Constitution? Federalism helps explain why each state has its own
               constitution and powers such as being able to choose what kind of ballots it uses, even in national elections. The national government oversees
               the election results, but each state controls its own voting procedures.[0m
