[91m        SHORT  It's not fair that fare means three unrelated things. As a verb, it means to proceed or get along, as in "Fare thee well." As a noun, it can refer to the cost
               of travel ("Train fare is ten dollars") or to food ("Tatertots are typical cafeteria fare").[0m
[36m         LONG  To remember fare's different meanings, think of how, for people living close to the bone, the question "How are you eating/faring?" is not so different from
               "How are you getting along/faring?" And when you pay plane fare and fly to France, you will most assuredly be eating French fare once you get
               there.[0m
