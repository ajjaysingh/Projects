[91m        SHORT  A flounder is a flat fish with both eyes on one side of its head; and, as a verb, to flounder is to wobble around like a fish out of water.[0m
[36m         LONG  To flounder is to be unsteady or uncertain. It's probably from the Dutch word floddern, "to flop about," or it's a mix of founder ("to fail") and blunder ("do
               something clumsy"). If you flounder in the ocean, you need a surfer dude to scoop you up. You don't have to be in water, though; you can
               flounder any time you're a little wobbly ‚Äî like after a long hike or during the last hour of the SATs. Either way, when you flounder, you wish
               you were a flat fish at the bottom of the sea.[0m
