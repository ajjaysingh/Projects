[91m        SHORT  A fatalist is someone who feels that no matter what he or she does, the outcome will be the same because it's predetermined. Fatalists share a sense of being
               powerless to change the world.[0m
[36m         LONG  In philosophy, a fatalist is someone who holds specific beliefs about life, destiny, and the future. Fatalists share the certainty that fate has already been
               laid out in front of them, and that they have no real control over what will happen. Sometimes fatalists have a flat or unemotional reaction
               even to frightening circumstances because of these beliefs. The Latin root is fatalis, "ordained by fate or destined."[0m
