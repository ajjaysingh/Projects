[36m         LONG  You're probably more familiar with the antonym of vincible, the adjective invincible, which means "unbeatable." Its opposite is much more rarely used, but it
               can be useful for talking about something â€” or someone â€” that can be defeated. The Latin root word of vincible, vincere, means "to conquer,"
               and it's also the origin of the words victor and victorious.[0m
