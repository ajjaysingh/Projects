[91m        SHORT  Fright is a feeling of fear, dread, or terror. You might scream in fright while watching a scary movie or riding a roller coaster.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some fright is so intense that it makes you jump; other fright is caused by anticipating something vaguely scary, like a trip to the dentist or an encounter
               with your mean neighbor after your baseball breaks her window. Although it's old fashioned, you can also use fright as a verb, to mean "cause
               fear." The Old English root of fright is fyrhtu, "fear, dread, trembling, or horrible sight."[0m
