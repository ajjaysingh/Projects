[91m        SHORT  People who exhibit fatalism appear powerless to shape their own future: they believe only in fate. I sense the fatalism in you, but you CAN change things![0m
[36m         LONG  You can see and hear the word "fate" in the word fatalism. It means "destiny" — the notion that all things are meant to be and that there is nothing you can
               do to change them. Someone "fatalistic" — who displays fatalism — sees life as a series of inevitable, predetermined events. Often, this term
               is used negatively to describe someone who refuses to try to shape their own lives or who gives up too easily. Fatalism may in fact be logical
               response to life, but that's no reason not to try to change things![0m
