  SHORT        The supporting point of a lever, the first fulcrum you met was probably on the playground — right underneath the see-saw.
  LONG         Back in the 17th century, a fulcrum referred to any general prop or support. Today it’s taken on more scientific connotations, thanks to Physics class.
               However, people still use fulcrum to describe something that plays an essential role or serves as the center of an activity or situation, such
               as the “fulcrum of the debate.” Or that mom who organized everybody’s playdates? She was the "fulcrum of the playground social circle."
