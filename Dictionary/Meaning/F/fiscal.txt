[91m        SHORT  The word fiscal resembles the word financial, which makes sense because both involve money.[0m
[36m         LONG  This word has to do with anything financial, which is another fancy word for the world of money. When you're an adult, you have fiscal responsibilities like
               paying rent, buying groceries, and paying taxes. If you put ten percent of your earnings in a savings account, that shows good fiscal sense.
               Businesses have a lot of fiscal matters to deal with, like paying salaries and trying to make a profit. If you need help with fiscal issues,
               consult an accountant.[0m
