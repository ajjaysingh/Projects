[91m        SHORT  If you know someone who's a fascist, that person is probably into control. A fascist is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian
               views and a strong central government ‚Äî and no tolerance for opposing opinions.[0m
[36m         LONG  Fascist traces to the Italian word fascio, meaning "group, bundle." Under fascist rule, the emphasis is on the group ‚Äî the nation ‚Äî with few individual
               rights. You must support the ruling party's views on society, politics, and culture ‚Äî or else. The term was used by Italian political leader
               Benito Mussolini under his totalitarian, anti-communist government. The word can describe someone who supports fascism ‚Äî or whose behavior is
               so stern and controlling that it seems like he does.[0m
