[91m        SHORT  If you know something’s coming, it’s foreseeable. Foreseeable things can be predicted or guessed ahead of time. If there’s no money for you in the foreseeable

[36m         LONG  The adjective foreseeable most often turns up in the phrase "the foreseeable future," which basically means "as far in the future as I can predict." The
               meaning is in the word – it’s the “before” you’re “able” to “see.”  You might be so mad at your sister that you tell her you won't drive her to
               school for the foreseeable future — in other words, you can't, at this point, imagine a time when you'll be willing to give her a ride.[0m
