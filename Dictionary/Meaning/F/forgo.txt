[91m        SHORT  The verb forgo means to give up or lose the right to something.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word forgo can be traced back to the Old English word forgƒÅn, which meant to pass away or to die, which is sometimes referred to as "giving up the ghost."
               Perhaps it was this idea of relinquishing something that led to our modern-day use of the word forgo to mean to give up, waive, or forfeit
               something. For example, someone charged with a crime might decide to forgo the right to remain silent and instead confess.[0m
