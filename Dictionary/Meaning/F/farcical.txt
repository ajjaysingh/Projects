[91m        SHORT  Something that's farcical is ridiculously funny ‚Äî absurd, even. When you stumbled onstage, tripping over your costume and pulling down the backdrop, you

[36m         LONG  If it resembles a farce ‚Äî a silly comedy that pokes fun at something ‚Äî you can describe it as farcical, which is pronounced "FAR-cih-kul." Farcical comes from
               the Latin farcire, "to stuff," which influenced the French farce, a "comic interlude in a mystery play." It's thought that farce came to have
               this meaning because it was "stuffed" in between acts.[0m
