[91m        SHORT  If you contract something highly infectious, such as pinkeye, please quarantine yourself so that you don‚Äôt infect others with it. This means you‚Äôll have to
               stay in isolation and avoid contact with other people.[0m
[36m         LONG  Starting in the 16th century, a quarantine lasted specifically 40 days. The word is in fact derived from the Latin quadraginta, which means "forty."
               Originally, this referred to the amount of time a widow could remain in her deceased husband‚Äôs house, then referred to the period of time a
               ship had to wait off a country‚Äôs port if its passengers were disease-stricken. Now, it can mean a period of isolation of any length, and can be
               used as both a verb and a noun.[0m
