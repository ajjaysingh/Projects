[91m        SHORT  Meaning to suppress or overcome, quell is what you have to do with nerves before a big test and fears before going skydiving.[0m
[36m         LONG  When it first came into existence, the verb quell actually meant ‚Äúto murder.‚Äù That's a bit more serious than our modern definition, but you can use that old
               definition to help you imagine offing your worries or putting a permanent end to criticism. These days quell is often used to mean "pacify," as
               in the police quelling an angry mob or a mom quelling a kid's temper tantrum.[0m
