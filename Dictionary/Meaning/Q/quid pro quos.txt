[36m         LONG  Ever hear the expression, "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"? That describes a quid pro quo: doing a favor you expect to be paid back, instead of doing
               the favor for its own sake. Politicians are often accused of doing a quid pro quo: someone donated to their campaign and is now getting favors
               in return. Quid pro quo definitely has a shady feel, but it just means making a deal that trades one thing for another.[0m
