[91m        SHORT  The adjective quiescent means "being quiet and still," like the quiescent moments lying in a hammock on a beautiful summer Sunday.[0m
[36m         LONG  To be quiescent, pronounced "qwhy-ESS-ent," is to be quiet, resting, which is exactly what its Latin origin quiescens means: In our busy world, it is hard to
               find a place to be quiescent. It has a second meaning: "causing no symptoms." For example, if a disease is quiescent, you probably won't know
               you have it. And finally, quiescent can mean "not activated," like quiescent cleaning products that don't get the stains out.[0m
