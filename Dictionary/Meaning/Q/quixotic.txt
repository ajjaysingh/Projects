[91m        SHORT  Use quixotic for someone or something that is romantic and unrealistic, or possessed by almost impossible hopes. Your quixotic task is easy to understand, if
               difficult to achieve: establish world peace.[0m
[36m         LONG  What a wonderful word quixotic is! While it is most often used to mean equally impractical and idealistic, it also has the sense of romantic nobility. Its
               source is from the great Spanish novel "Don Quixote," whose title character is given to unrealistic schemes and great chivalry. In the middle
               of a recession and high unemployment, it would be quixotic to imagine that you could quit your job and find another easily.[0m
