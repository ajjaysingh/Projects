[91m        SHORT  A quibble is a small argument or fight. As a verb, it means to pick a mini-fight over something that doesn't really matter. "Let's not quibble over price,"
               people will say, usually when they plan to gouge you.[0m
[36m         LONG  It's better to watch figure skating with the sound off, rather than listening to the announcers quibble over a not-fully-rotated knee or the slightly
               diminished altitude of a jump. Sometimes a quibble between neighbors over two feet of property can escalate into a major feud.[0m
