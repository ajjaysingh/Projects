[91m        SHORT  Querulous means ‚Äúhaving a tendency to complain‚Äù or, more directly put, ‚Äúwhiny.‚Äù Sure, no one can be happy all the time, but that‚Äôs no excuse for being
               querulous.[0m
[36m         LONG  Querulous may remind you of the word query, which means ‚Äúquestion.‚Äù However, the two words are not closely related. It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to make a query;
               just don‚Äôt be querulous if you don‚Äôt like the answer you get. Querulous does share its origins with the word quarrel, which means ‚Äúargument‚Äù -‚Äì
               and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs likely to happen if you complain too much.[0m
