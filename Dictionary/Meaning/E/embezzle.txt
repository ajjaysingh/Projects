[91m        SHORT  When a person embezzles, it usually means that he is stealing money from his employer. If he is caught embezzling, it probably also means that he will soon be
               unemployed.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word embezzle implies more than simply "to steal." When a person embezzles, he or she takes advantage of an employer's trust for personal gain. Embezzling
               is a so-called "white-collar crime" which often involves some sort of cover-up, like falsifying financial records or stealing small amounts of
               money over a long period of time. The word embezzle comes from an Old French word meaning "maltreat or ravage," besillier, and an embezzler can
               be said to ravage someone else's money.[0m
