[91m        SHORT  A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off ‚Äî all of these could be described as evanescent, which means
               ‚Äúfleeting‚Äù or ‚Äútemporary.‚Äù[0m
[36m         LONG  Evanescent comes from the Latin ex, meaning "out of," and vanescere, meaning "to vanish." When pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note
               that the c is silent. You might want to practice saying evanescent a few times right now; if you stumble over pronunciation when you need this
               word the most, whatever you‚Äôre describing ‚Äî be it a shooting star or a whiff of fragrant perfume ‚Äî will be gone.[0m
