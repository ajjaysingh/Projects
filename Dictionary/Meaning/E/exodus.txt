[36m         LONG  Exodus is the title of the second book of the Bible‚Äôs Old Testament in which the Israelites escape slavery in Egypt, but the term can refer to any sudden
               departure of a group of people. This noun is often coupled with the adjective mass, as in ‚Äúmass exodus,‚Äù which usually indicates that almost
               everyone leaves at the same time. The reasons for this departure can be hostile, as during a war, or not, as when everyone exits the movie
               theater after the show's over.[0m
