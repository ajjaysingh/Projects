[91m        SHORT  Exhilaration is great joy, and excitement and liveliness! When you ride an ocean wave, hear a favorite song, or have a long and uncontrollable laugh with
               friends, there's a feeling of exhilaration, an overflow of happiness.[0m
[36m         LONG  Most people have moments of exhilaration (egg-zill-uh-RAY-shun), sometimes during life's big moments, like a graduation or wedding, and often while just
               walking down the street and feeling great about the day and being alive. And exhilaration is contagious: when you witness someone else's
               exhilaration, it usually makes you full of warmth and joyousness too. Some synonyms of exhilaration also sound close to it, like "exultation,"
               "exaltation," and "elation." As they say, it's all good.[0m
