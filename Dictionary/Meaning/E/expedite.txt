[36m         LONG  If someone says, "Let me expedite the process," that's probably a good thing: they're offering to speed things up. If you've ever waited in line a long time,
               then you must have wished someone could expedite things. A driver can expedite his commute by going in the faster car-pool lane. Whenever
               there's a lot of paperwork for something, it's nice to know someone who can expedite the process. When you see the word expedite, think "Make
               faster!"[0m
