[91m        SHORT  When you emend a piece of writing, you correct or revise it. If you are asked to emend a report, that just means you need to go through it and make revisions.[0m
[36m         LONG  Emend is similar in spelling and pronunciation to another word, amend, and there‚Äôs a slight overlap in meaning as well. Emend refers to changes and
               improvements made to a text. Amend also can refer to making minor changes to a text, but it can be used to describe improvements made to other
               things as well ‚Äî for example, you can amend a situation. In contrast, emend‚Äôs powers are limited to words. So if you‚Äôre using emend ‚Äî the one
               with the "e" ‚Äî just make sure you‚Äôre describing improvements that involve text.[0m
