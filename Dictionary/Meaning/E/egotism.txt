[91m        SHORT  If you think that there's nothing better than being you, then you're full of egotism, a word for an inflated sense of self-importance.[0m
[36m         LONG  Most people believe it's good to have positive feelings about yourself and healthy self-esteem. But some people feel a little too good about themselves, and
               that's called egotism. People suffering from egotism think the world revolves around them. They're arrogant, cocky, overconfident, selfish, and
               generally think they're better than other people. And having an ego of that size is generally not a good thing.[0m
