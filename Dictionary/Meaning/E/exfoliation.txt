[91m        SHORT  Scrub the dead skin off your face and enjoy some exfoliation! It sounds gross but feels really good. Exfoliation is the process of buffing off the outer layer
               of skin cells or shedding parts of a surface.[0m
[36m         LONG  Exfoliation often refers to something people have done at a spa, but it’s not just for humans. A tree's exfoliation involves its bark being peeled off or
               leaves falling off. You could also call a snake shedding its entire scaly skin exfoliation (though it's officially known as ecdysis or
               shedding). When a plant loses its leaves, it's exfoliation — this is appropriate since exfoliation stems from the Latin exfoliare, "to strip of
               leaves."[0m
