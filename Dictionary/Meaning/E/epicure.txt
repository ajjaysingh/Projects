[91m        SHORT  We call a person who truly loves food—food at the highest levels—an epicure. Occasionally, you might find the word epicure used for a person who loves
               something else, but an epicure is usually someone who delights in fine food.[0m
[36m         LONG  Epicurus was the Greek philosopher whom we credit with thinking the most about cooking and food. So any time you see the word epicure, remember that that
               person follows the philosopher Epicurus and therefore loves food.  Being an epicure ain't cheap. Most fine restaurants these days will charge
               you an arm and a leg for a meal good enough to satisfy a real epicure: a good bottle of wine alone could cost the choosy epicure a couple of
               Benjamins ($100 bills).[0m
