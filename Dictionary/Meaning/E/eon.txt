[91m        SHORT  An eon is a really, really, super-long, impossible-to-measure length of time. If you sit down to dinner hanging your head and moaning that it's been an eon
               since you ate anything, you‚Äôre exaggerating. Four hours ago is not an eon.[0m
[36m         LONG  Eon goes back to the Greek ai≈çn, "age." An age is not easy to measure, and neither is an eon. Both are just really long periods of time, but in science an eon
               is about a billion years. You can use the noun eon for anything that takes a long while, including how long it will be before another planet
               collides with Earth or how many days until summer vacation starts ‚Äî one is an eon, the other feels like an eon, or forever.[0m
