[91m        SHORT  If you are exiled from a place, you must leave and not return. Such punishment is called exile. For example, after he was removed from power, Napoleon lived
               in exile on the island of Elba.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb exile comes from the Old French word essillier, meaning ‚Äúbanish,‚Äù ‚Äúexpel,‚Äù or ‚Äúdrive off.‚Äù However, some people who live in exile do so happily ‚Äî and
               voluntarily ‚Äî like American citizens in exile in Paris. Don't confuse being exiled with being banned: exile is for countries. If you cause
               trouble at a restaurant, you might be banned from returning, not exiled.[0m
