[91m        SHORT  Ebony is a very dark black color, or a south Asian tropical tree with hard, dark-colored heartwood. Black piano keys and black chess pieces are often made
               with ebony.[0m
[36m         LONG  Used as a noun or adjective, ebony derives from Greek word ebenos, meaning "ebony" and was first used in the 17th century to describe a very dark black color.
               Cabinetry made out of ebony was very fashionable during the Victorian era because it was imported and considered exotic, but today, because it
               is considered a threatened species, its uses are limited to small objects, such as animal carvings or parts of musical instruments.[0m
