[36m         LONG  When you're interviewing someone, their effusiveness makes them a great subject â€” they have so many interesting things to say â€” although it can be hard for
               you to get a word in edgewise. In a typical preschool classroom, there are kids who are quiet and shy, and others whose effusiveness leads them
               to talk incessantly. This noun comes from the related adjective, effusive, "flowing profusely," from the Latin effundere, "to pour forth or
               spread abroad."[0m
