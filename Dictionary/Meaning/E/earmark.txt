[91m        SHORT  To earmark something is to set it aside for a specific purpose. If you‚Äôre saving money to spend it in a particular way ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs for college or a fancy
               new pair of shoes ‚Äî you have earmarked that money.[0m
[36m         LONG  Originally, an earmark was a mark on the ear of an animal ‚Äî such as a sheep ‚Äî that indicated ownership. Similarly, when government officials earmark a
               resource, they're indicating what the resource will be used for. Earmarking is usually about money. $10,000 could be earmarked for cancer
               research. A grant could be earmarked for a children's hospital. Earmarking is a way of stating how something will be used.[0m
