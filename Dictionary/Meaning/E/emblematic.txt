[36m         LONG  If you know that an emblem is a visual symbol, then you won't be surprised that emblematic things stand for other things. In fact, the word emblem comes from
               the French word for symbol. Something emblematic represents a larger issue, good or bad. Sometimes emblematic is used for things that are
               excellent examples. An A student is an emblematic student, and a war hero is an emblematic soldier. Emblematic people are symbols of what
               others aspire to be.[0m
