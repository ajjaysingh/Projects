[91m        SHORT  Expediency gets you what you want.  While its tone can be neutral, expediency often suggests self-interest, possibly at the expense of doing what's right.[0m
[36m         LONG  Expediency comes from the word expedient, which derived from the Latin expedientem, meaning "beneficial."  The negative aspect of the word came about in the
               18th Century, taking on the aspect of doing something in the most convenient and advantageous manner, even though that way might be against
               conventional ethics.  As W. Somerset Maugham once wrote, ‚ÄúThe most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to
               expediency.‚Äù[0m
