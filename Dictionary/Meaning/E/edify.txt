[91m        SHORT  To edify is to help someone understand, whether it is books that edify those who want to learn a new language, or the explanations that hang beside paintings
               at a museum that edify visitors who aren't familiar with the artist.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you know that the noun edifice is a synonym for building, you may wonder what the related verb edify has to do with understanding. You can think of
               something that edifies as the building blocks of what might become a lifelong interest, like an elementary school teacher who edifies the
               student who becomes an Abraham Lincoln scholar, or an activity you eventually master, like the beginners' lessons that edify new ice skaters.[0m

      Origin:  Middle English: from Old French edifier, from Latin aedificare ‘build’, from aedis ‘dwelling’ + facere ‘make’ (compare with edifice). The word originally
               meant ‘construct a building’, also ‘strengthen’, hence to ‘build up’ morally.
