[91m        SHORT  Enmity means intense hostility. If you're a football fanatic, you feel enmity for your opposing team.[0m
[36m         LONG  Enmity comes from the same Latin root as enemy, and means the state of being an enemy. If you have always hated someone, you have a history of enmity with
               that person. Enmity is stronger than antagonism or animosity, which imply competitive feeling but don't go all the way to enemy status.
               Hopefully you are a peacemaker and don't experience too much enmity in your life.[0m
