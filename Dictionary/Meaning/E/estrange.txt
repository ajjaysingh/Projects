[91m        SHORT  To estrange people may sound like adding wobbly antennae and an extra eyeball to their faces. Really, estrange means to push apart people who were once close
               to each other and cause them to be like strangers.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb estrange comes from the Old French estranger, "to treat like a stranger.” Estrange is often used when talking about family members who are no longer
               in contact with each other. You can also speak about wanting to estrange the neighbor’s dog from your flowerbed or a writer who estranges her
               readers by using too many big words. If you're looking for a synonym that is less “strange” but more “alien,” try alienate.[0m
