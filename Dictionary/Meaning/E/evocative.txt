[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective evocative when you want to describe something that reminds you of something else. If your mom baked a lot when you were a kid, the smell of
               cookies in the oven is probably evocative of your childhood.[0m
[36m         LONG  Evocative comes from the Latin word evocare, which means to "call out" or "summon."  Think of a batch of cookies summoning a memory from your childhood. To
               summon something you need a voice, and indeed, the Latin word for voice is vocare.  Other related words include the noun vocation, which means
               "a calling."[0m
