[91m        SHORT  The degree to which a method or medicine brings about a specific result is its efficacy. You might not like to eat it, but you can't question the efficacy of
               broccoli as a health benefit.[0m
[36m         LONG  Efficacy is a more formal way to say effectiveness, both of which stem from the Latin verb efficere "to work out, accomplish." The effectiveness, or efficacy,
               of something is how well it works or brings the results you hoped for. A scientist does research to determine the efficacy of a vaccine or
               medicine under development. If it is efficacious, it will cure or prevent a disease.[0m
