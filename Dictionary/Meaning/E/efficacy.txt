  LONG         Efficacy is a more formal way to say effectiveness, both of which stem from the Latin verb efficere "to work out, accomplish." The effectiveness, or efficacy,
               of something is how well it works or brings the results you hoped for. A scientist does research to determine the efficacy of a vaccine or
               medicine under development. If it is efficacious, it will cure or prevent a disease.
