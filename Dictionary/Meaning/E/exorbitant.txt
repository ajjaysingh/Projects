[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective exorbitant when you want to describe something that is really just too much! You'll often hear people griping about exorbitant bank fees or
               exorbitant interest rates.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective exorbitant was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds of the law. It comes from the Latin roots ‚Äî the prefix ex,
               meaning "out of," and orbita, meaning "wheel track." You can see how the word now has come to be described as something that has gone way off
               the beaten track, especially in terms of price and value.[0m
