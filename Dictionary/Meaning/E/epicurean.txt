[91m        SHORT  Used as a noun or adjective, epicurean refers to a devotion to pleasure or refined, sensuous enjoyment, especially of good food and drink.[0m
[36m         LONG  Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher this word was named after, taught his students that pleasure was a sign of the good, and pain a sign of evil. Thus the
               "good life" was one filled with pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Over the centuries, epicurean has come to refer to the pursuit of the finer
               things in life, and the word has a whole host of great synonyms, including luxurious, voluptuous, hedonistic, and, as a noun, bon vivant.[0m
