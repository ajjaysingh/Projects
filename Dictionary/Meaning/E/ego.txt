[91m        SHORT  Your ego is your conscious mind, the part of your identity that you consider your "self." If you say someone has "a big ego," then you are saying he is too

[36m         LONG  Poor ego, it gets such a bad rap, being so often confused with "megalomania" and "vanity" and all kinds of other nasty things, but strictly speaking it is
               only a psychological term popularized by Freud meaning the conscious (as opposed to the unconscious) mind, or the awareness of one's own
               identity and existence. Nothing wrong in that, is there?[0m
