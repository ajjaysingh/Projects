[91m        SHORT  When you see your mysterious neighbor digging around in his backyard, you may wonder if he’s trying to exhume something. Chances are he’s only digging up
               potatoes — when you exhume something, it means you’re digging up a corpse.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word exhume traces back to the Latin word exhumare, a combination of ex-, meaning “out of,” and humus, or “ground.” That meaning holds true today: when
               you exhume something, you dig it up out of the ground. The word almost always applies to the removing of a previously buried corpse, such as
               law enforcement officials who exhume a body to perform an autopsy or collect evidence related to an investigation.[0m
