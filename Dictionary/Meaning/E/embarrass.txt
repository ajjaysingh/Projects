[91m        SHORT  If you embarrass someone, you make them feel self-conscious, awkward, or even stupid. Your mom might embarrass you by inviting your date to check out your

[36m         LONG  Embarrass actually has another meaning, but it's very rarely used: to blockade, hinder, obstruct, or stymie. Nowadays, we tend to embarrass one another (and
               ourselves) by pretty much sticking to the basics: making fun of our friends when they blunder, accidentally revealing secrets in public,
               confessing our undying love to people who don't even know we exist, and all the millions of creative and frustrating ways we have of making
               mistakes.[0m
