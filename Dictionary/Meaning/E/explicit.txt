[36m         LONG  Thanks to parental-advisory warnings about "explicit language" or "explicit violence," you might think this word only applies to things that are dirty,
               naughty, or adult in some way. That is a common meaning of explicit, but it's not the only meaning. This also means anything that is clear and
               easy to understand. Explicit orders are easy to carry out; explicit instructions are easy to follow. When someone is explicit, they're not
               beating around the bush or being confusing.[0m
