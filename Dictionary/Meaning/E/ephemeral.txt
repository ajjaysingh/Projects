[36m         LONG  Ephemeral (…ô-FEM-…ôr-…ôl) was originally a medical term with the specific meaning "lasting only one day," as a fever or sickness (Hemera means "day" in Greek.)
               The word became more general, coming to mean "lasting a short time," covering the life spans of plants or insects and then eventually anything
               that is fleeting or transitory. A related word is the plural noun ephemera, meaning "things that are meant to last for only a short time."
               Posters for a rock concert are often ephemera, unless the band is so famous that they get saved and sold on eBay.[0m
