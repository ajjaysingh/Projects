[36m         LONG  If you can do things quickly and well, then you're good at being expeditious. In math, there are often many ways to get an answer: the quickest method is the
               most expeditious. There might be many ways to get home from school, but the fastest is the most expeditious. But there's more to being
               expeditious than just speed ‚Äî you have to get a good result too. If you solve a problem quickly but get it wrong, that's not very expeditious.[0m
