[91m        SHORT  Something that is egregious stands out, but not in a good way ‚Äî it means "really bad or offensive." If you make an egregious error during a championship
               soccer match, your coach might bench you for the rest of the game.[0m
[36m         LONG  "My massage therapist gave me bruises," someone complained recently on Twitter, asking, "When does it cease to be deep tissue massage therapy and become
               egregious and unabashed manhandling?" An egregious error is hardly forgivable. Some synonyms are shocking, appalling, and intolerable. The word
               has made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant "exceptionally good." Word historians have speculated that the
               negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean "outstanding,"
               since no one wants to be called egregious.[0m
