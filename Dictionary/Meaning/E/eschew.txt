[36m         LONG  Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn‚Äôt simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle‚Äì‚Äìit's stronger
               than that. You eschew things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a
               chocolate sundae, not because he doesn‚Äôt like it, but because he‚Äôs afraid of what it will do to his waistline.[0m
