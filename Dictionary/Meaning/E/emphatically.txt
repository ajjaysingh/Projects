[36m         LONG  Emphatically, pronounced "em-FAT-ick-lee," shares the same origin as emphasize, which means "to stress or put particular importance on something." When you
               say or do something emphatically, you really mean it. For example, if you emphatically say "no" when someone asks you on a date, that person
               isn't likely to ask you ‚Äî or even look in your direction ‚Äî again.[0m
