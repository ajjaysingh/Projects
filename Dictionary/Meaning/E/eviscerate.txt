[91m        SHORT  Eviscerate is not a pretty word. To eviscerate can mean to remove the entrails of a creature. On the Discovery Channel you can watch a vulture eviscerate or
               take out the guts of a dead animal.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word eviscerate comes from the Latin evisceratus, meaning "to disembowel." It's not strictly used in such a gruesome sense though. Sure, you can
               eviscerate a chicken by gutting its insides, but eviscerate can also be used to describe when you deprive something of its most important
               quality. If you take away the disco ball, it could eviscerate the spirit of your dance party.[0m
