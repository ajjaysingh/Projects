[91m        SHORT  An estuary is the place in the water where a tide and a river current meet, like the estuary at New York Harbor, where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic
               Ocean.[0m
[36m         LONG  Estuary, pronounced "ES-choo-air-ee," comes from the Latin word aestuarium, meaning "a tidal marsh or opening." The calm waters of an estuary, where the mouth
               of a river connects with the open sea and fresh water mixes with salty ocean water, makes the perfect home for many species of aquatic plants
               and animals. Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound are estuaries.[0m
