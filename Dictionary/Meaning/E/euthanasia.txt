[91m        SHORT  Euthanasia is the act of causing a person's or animal's death, without inflicting pain, to end suffering, like when a veterinarian performs euthanasia on a
               dog that is in great pain and has no chance of recovery.[0m
[36m         LONG  To correctly pronounce euthanasia, remember that it sounds like "youth in Asia." Euthanasia is sometimes referred to as mercy killing, meant to spare a living
               thing a slow, painful death. Originally a Greek word, euthanasia means  "an easy or happy death," as eu- means "good" and thanatos means
               "death." The use of the word as "legally sanctioned mercy killing" is first recorded in English in 1869.[0m
