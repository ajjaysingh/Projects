[91m        SHORT  If you have epilepsy, you have a central nervous system disorder that may cause you to lose consciousness and have convulsions.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun epilepsy comes from the Greek word epilƒìpsia, which itself means seizure. Not all seizures are caused by epilepsy, but an epileptic seizure occurs
               when a strong electrical disturbance occurs in the brain. The severity and intensity of the seizures depend on many factors and are unique to
               each person. It may be possible to control seizures through medication, although not everyone with epilepsy will respond to medication. People
               with uncontrolled epilepsy should not drive.[0m
