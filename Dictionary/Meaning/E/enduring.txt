[91m        SHORT  Many people have an enduring love for ice cream, that is, they have loved it for a long time and will continue to love it into the future. Enduring means
               long-lasting.[0m
[36m         LONG  Enduring has roots that go back about 1,500 years to the Late Latin period. It is quite an enduring word! The original root meant hard, so your enduring
               friendship or your enduring interest in sports is solid enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning long-lasting, enduring sometimes
               means long-suffering as when someone has an enduring disposition, but this meaning is found in the verb more than in the adjective.[0m
