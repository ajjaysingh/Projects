[91m        SHORT  To ensnare something is to trap it. Instead of using snapping mousetraps, you might try to ensnare the mice in your kitchen and set them free outside.[0m
[36m         LONG  While you can use the verb ensnare to talk about literally catching something in a trap, it's also useful for more figurative kinds of traps. Your French
               teacher might try to ensnare you in becoming more involved in the French club, or rush hour traffic might ensnare you as you rush to make it to
               work on time. The word combines the prefix en, or "put in," and snare, with its Old Norse root snara, "noose or snare."[0m
