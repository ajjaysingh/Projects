[91m        SHORT  If you need to be untangled, set free or otherwise released from something or someone, you need to be extricated.[0m
[36m         LONG  Extricate is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means "out" or "out of," and the Latin word tricae, which means "hindrances." So to extricate is to get out of
               what's hindering you. But it's not always so simple. You just try and extricate yourself from the loving death grip of a grandma who hasn't
               seen you in awhile![0m
