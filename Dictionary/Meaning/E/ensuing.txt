               effect. Blame your for entrepreneurial friend taking bets in the lunchroom for the ensuing crackdown on employee gambling. An ensuing event
               happens right after its cause. If a dog bites you when you're eight, and twenty years later you start having nightmares about dog bites, those
               aren't ensuing nightmares. They're surfacing memories.[0m
