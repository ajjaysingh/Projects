[91m        SHORT  An elegy is a sad poem, usually written to praise and express sorrow for someone who is dead. Although a speech at a funeral is a eulogy, you might later
               compose an elegy to someone you have loved and lost to the grave.[0m
[36m         LONG  The purpose of this kind of poem is to express feelings rather than tell a story. Thomas Gray's ‚ÄúElegy Written in a Country Churchyard‚Äù is a poem that
               reflects on the lives of common people buried in a church cemetery, and on the nature of human mortality. The noun elegy was borrowed in the
               16th century from Middle French √©l√©gie, from Latin elegƒ´a, from Greek elegeia, from elegos "mournful poem or song."[0m
