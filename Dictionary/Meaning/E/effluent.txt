  SHORT        If a local company is accused of dumping effluent into the water supply, then you'd better stock up on bottled water. Effluent is sewage or other waste that’s
               dumped into water.
  LONG         Effluent traces back to a Latin word meaning “flowing out,” and as an adjective the word can still be used in that sense. An effluent stream is one whose
               water is continually flowing out of the ground, from a spring or other source. But the noun form of effluent refers to waste of some kind
               that’s been mixed with water. If effluent is released, it can contaminate a water supply. Gross.

               effluent.
     >         In 2015, the city committed to use treated effluent from the Dairy Farmers of America milk drying plant that is under construction in Garden City.
     >         The community has also built septic tanks in dozens of the small homes, ensuring effluent is not poured untreated into the river.
     >         But while oysters help filter water, they do not themselves consume nitrates produced by human effluent or intensive agriculture.
     >         A case in point is our reluctance to adopt market-based measures like congestion pricing and effluent fees.
