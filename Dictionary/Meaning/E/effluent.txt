[91m        SHORT  If a local company is accused of dumping effluent into the water supply, then you'd better stock up on bottled water. Effluent is sewage or other waste that‚Äôs
               dumped into water.[0m
[36m         LONG  Effluent traces back to a Latin word meaning ‚Äúflowing out,‚Äù and as an adjective the word can still be used in that sense. An effluent stream is one whose
               water is continually flowing out of the ground, from a spring or other source. But the noun form of effluent refers to waste of some kind
               that‚Äôs been mixed with water. If effluent is released, it can contaminate a water supply. Gross.[0m
