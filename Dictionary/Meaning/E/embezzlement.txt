[91m        SHORT  If you are glee club treasurer, and you pocket twenty glee dollars saying you used it to buy lozenges, you are committing embezzlement, the theft of money or
               property that you officially manage.[0m
[36m         LONG  In order for stealing to be embezzlement, you need to both be in charge of the funds or property you are stealing, and you need to conceal your theft. Because
               of this, it is classified as a type of fraud. People who commit embezzlement often create fake paper trails — receipts, canceled checks, false
               signatures — to hide their crime.[0m
