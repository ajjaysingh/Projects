               assembled their doctrines by picking and choosing from a variety of philosophical systems. Today, the word can refer to any assemblage of
               varied parts. You can have an eclectic group of friends (friends from diverse groups), eclectic taste in furniture (a mixture of 18th-century
               French chairs, Andy Warhol paintings, and Persian rugs), or enjoy eclectic cuisine (fusion cooking that uses ingredients from different
               national cuisines).[0m
