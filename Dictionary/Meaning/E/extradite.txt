[91m        SHORT  When a government extradites someone, it delivers that person to another country or state, usually to be tried for a crime. Treaties between countries often
               require them to extradite suspected criminals.[0m
[36m         LONG  You might hear about a criminal attempting to hide in one country, only to have its government extradite him back to the place where he committed the crime.
               While individual countries sometimes resist the pressure to extradite suspects, treaties between countries often encourage them to do so. The
               verb extradite comes from its noun form, extradition, which was likely invented by Voltaire from a combination of the Latin ex, "out," and
               traditionem, "a delivering up or handing over."[0m
