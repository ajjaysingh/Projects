[91m        SHORT  If something's exact, it's precise and completely accurate ‚Äî as opposed to a guess, an estimate, or an approximation.[0m
[36m         LONG  Exact also has the meaning of taking something from someone, often money, and generally only given up with reluctance under the threat of force. The Mob might
               exact a shakedown from unfortunate businessmen, for example. The word comes from the Latin exactus "exact or accurate," a form of the verb
               exigere ‚Äî meaning "to force out or demand," like the Mob demanding its money.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English (as a verb): from Latin exact- ‚Äòcompleted, ascertained, enforced‚Äô, from the verb exigere, from ex- ‚Äòthoroughly‚Äô + agere ‚Äòperform‚Äô. The
               adjective dates from the mid 16th century and reflects the Latin exactus ‚Äòprecise‚Äô.
