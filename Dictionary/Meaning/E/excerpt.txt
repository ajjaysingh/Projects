[91m        SHORT  Instead of sharing all 147 lines of your favorite poem in class, you might want to read an excerpt, that is, just a part of the verses, so no one dozes off.[0m
[36m         LONG  Excerpt sounds a lot like "except" with an added "r," and it came into English in the 16th century from a Latin word meaning "plucked out." When the word is
               used as a verb, excerpt means to take a portion out, usually from a play, book, article, song, or other written work. And the part that is
               taken out also is called an excerpt, but it is a noun, that is, a thing. An excerpt is something you excerpt, or pluck out, from a larger
               piece.[0m
