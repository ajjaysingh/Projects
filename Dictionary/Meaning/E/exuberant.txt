[91m        SHORT  Are you feeling really happy and enthusiastic about something? Describe yourself with the adjective exuberant![0m
[36m         LONG  Exuberant can be traced back to the same Indo-European root that has brought the word udder. If you picture the plentiful amount of milk a cow can give, it is
               easy to remember that exuberant always describes something that is abundant or plentiful like exuberant foliage. Abundance also comes into play
               in its primary use today to mean very enthusiastic, full of energy or overjoyed. When the bell rings on the last day of school, you will be
               exuberant.[0m
