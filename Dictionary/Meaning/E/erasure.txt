[36m         LONG  An erasure can be made, appropriately, by erasing pencilled words with an eraser, but there are many other kinds of erasure. You can experience an accidental
               erasure of a whole day's work by hitting the wrong button on your laptop, and you can choose to hide details of your past with the kind of
