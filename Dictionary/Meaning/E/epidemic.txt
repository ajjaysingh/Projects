[91m        SHORT  An epidemic is a disease that spreads rapidly among many people in a community at the same time. In the 1980s, the fast-spreading AIDS epidemic transformed

[36m         LONG  Epidemic can be used figuratively to refer to something that spreads or grows rapidly: an epidemic of laziness has taken over the tenth grade. This word is
               from French √©pid√©mique, ultimately from Greek epidƒìmia "staying in one place, among the people." The related word pandemic refers to a disease
               that spreads throughout an entire country or throughout the world.[0m
