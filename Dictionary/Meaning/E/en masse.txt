[91m        SHORT  The adverb en masse means all together, like when the priest asked if anyone objected to your wedding during the ceremony, and the audience raised their hands
               en masse.[0m
[36m         LONG  En masse comes from French literature, from the phrase "in mass." In this case, mass means "all the people." So, when you do something en masse, everyone does
               it together. Voting en masse means an entire group of people votes the same way. If everyone stands up and leaves a place en masse, it might be
               hard to get out the door.[0m
