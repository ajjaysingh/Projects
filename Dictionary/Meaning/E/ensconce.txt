[91m        SHORT  If you ensconce yourself somewhere, you settle in for quite a while, such as when you're home with the flu and ensconce yourself on the couch with the remote
               control, tissues, your phone, and a big glass of orange juice.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ensconce dates to the 1580s, when it literally meant "to cover with a fort." It isn't quite clear whether the word can be traced to French or Dutch, which has
               a word schans that describes "earthwork." Today, you don't need a protective structure like a fort in order to be ensconced, but the idea of
               being surrounded is key to the word's meaning.[0m
