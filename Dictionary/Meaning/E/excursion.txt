[36m         LONG  The Latin root for excursion is excurrere, meaning "to run out." So if you run out for a bit to get some fresh air, you've gone on an excursion. If you leave
               specifically to buy milk from the corner store and end up swimming in a stream, you've probably taken an excursion into the woods.[0m
