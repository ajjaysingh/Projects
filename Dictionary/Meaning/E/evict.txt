                                                                                      EVICT                                                                                       
  SHORT        Use the verb evict to say that a tenant is being forced to move out of his home, usually through legal action. If you don't pay your rent, eventually your
               landlord will evict you.
  LONG         Evict became part of the English language back in the 1530s. Based on the Latin word evincere, meaning "recover property, overcome and expel, conquer," even
               then it had a legal process attached to it. Before you evict someone, you have to complete official paperwork, though some landlords may
               succeed in evicting tenants without following the legal steps.

     >         The agency previously had said it would not evict protesters due to free speech reasons.
     >         But the evicted families have resettled in another vacant plot of land near the river not too far away.
     >         “Do not demolish us, do not evict us. We do not know were we would go.”
     >         Roberts and dozens of other disenrolled members who live on tribal land could now be evicted from their homes.
     >         The ultimate goal is the same: Evict the Sunni extremist group Islamic State from the country.
