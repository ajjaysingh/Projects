[91m        SHORT  Use the verb evict to say that a tenant is being forced to move out of his home, usually through legal action. If you don't pay your rent, eventually your
               landlord will evict you.[0m
[36m         LONG  Evict became part of the English language back in the 1530s. Based on the Latin word evincere, meaning "recover property, overcome and expel, conquer," even
               then it had a legal process attached to it. Before you evict someone, you have to complete official paperwork, though some landlords may
               succeed in evicting tenants without following the legal steps.[0m
