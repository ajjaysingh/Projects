[91m        SHORT  An epitaph is an inscription on a gravestone. Famous for his comedic jabs at the City of Brotherly Love, writer W.C. Fields once said he wanted "I'd rather be
               living in Philadelphia" as the epitaph on his tombstone.[0m
[36m         LONG  Once you trace this word back to its origins, you'll never forget its meaning. Forms of it show up in Middle English, Old French, Latin, and, before that,
               Greek: epi- "upon" and taphos "tomb." This gives us a mini history lesson on burial traditions. For thousands of years various societies have
               carved poetic, weepy, and witty words onto the monuments marking the final resting places of famous and infamous citizens.[0m
