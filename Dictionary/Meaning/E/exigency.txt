                                                                                     EXIGENCY                                                                                     
  SHORT        Think of a mix of excitement and emergency, and you have exigency, a sudden, urgent crisis. The very word conjures up danger and intrigue that demand a cool
               head and an immediate effort at a solution.
  LONG         The meaning of exigency is obvious from its source, the Latin noun exigentia, which means "urgency" and comes from the verb exigere, meaning "to demand or
               require." An emergency situation, or  exigency, is urgent and demands immediate action. Our lives are filled with exigencies, both large and
               small, from a child stuck in a tree to lightning striking your house to catastrophic river flooding. Each is an exigency — it's all a matter of
               perspective.
