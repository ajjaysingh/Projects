[91m        SHORT  If you rudely behave as if you have a right to something that you have no right to, you're committing effrontery. When a couple stroll into a crowded
               restaurant, demand the best table, and threaten the staff unless they're seated right away, that's effrontery.[0m
[36m         LONG  People have been guilty of outrageously self-centered behavior at least since 1715, when effrontery was coined. Tracing to the French word effront√©, meaning
               "shameless," the word effrontery is also connected to brazen, which means "of brass," and describes someone so accustomed to effrontery that
               he's hardened to it and has no concern for the harm done to others.[0m
