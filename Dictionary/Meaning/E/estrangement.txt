[91m        SHORT  Estrangement is the feeling that you don't belong, especially when you're surrounded by other people. If you've ever had to sit by yourself in a school

               someone ‚Äî makes you feel like a stranger. It can describe a couple that's split up or the alienation of a former friend. The meaning hasn't
               changed much from its Latin root, extraneare, "treat as a stranger."[0m
