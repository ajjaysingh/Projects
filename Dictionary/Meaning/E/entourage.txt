[91m        SHORT  You know that group of people — friends, assistants, bodyguards — that are always surrounding you everywhere you go?  That's your entourage![0m
[36m         LONG  Entourage comes from the French word entourer, meaning “to surround,” and means "the people who surround someone."  It's also pronounced like a French word,
               ending with the soft  sound “razh” (not “rage”): "ON-too-razh."  The size of a pop star's entourage might grow with every hit record she
               releases. You know you've really made it when your entourage won't fit in one limo.[0m
