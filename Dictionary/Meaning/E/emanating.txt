[91m        SHORT  When you use the word emanate, you're usually talking about lights, sounds, or unseen forces coming out of a specific source. If you hear creepy sounds
               emanating from an old house, that might mean it's haunted.[0m
[36m         LONG  Emanate derives from the Latin e- 'out' and manare to flow. If that last word looks a little like manure to you, you might be interested to know that they're
               not at all related. Thank goodness, too, because the idea of manure flowing outâ€“â€“or emanatingâ€“â€“is not something to be discussed in polite
               company.[0m
