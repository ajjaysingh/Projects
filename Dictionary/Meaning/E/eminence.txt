[91m        SHORT  Eminence is superior status. If you become a world famous actor, the folks in your home town might treat you as an eminence when you come home for
               Thanksgiving. Just don't expect your family to do the same.[0m
[36m         LONG  Eminence traces back to the Latin adjective ƒìminƒìntia, meaning high or lofty. We don't usually use it for mountain tops, however; it's social loftiness that
               scores eminence. Some special people are addressed as "your eminence," in the same way you'd call a judge "your honor." You can attain eminence
               or be an eminence. If you become a physical therapist, you might work with another kind of eminence: the high bit protruding from a bone where
               muscles or ligaments attach.[0m
