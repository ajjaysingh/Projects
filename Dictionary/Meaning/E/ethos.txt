[91m        SHORT  Ethos is the spirit of a time or society. It‚Äôs the set of beliefs a community lives by. Free spirits might live by the ethos of "anything goes." Zombies might
               live by the ethos ‚Äúeat more brains.‚Äù[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun ethos refers to the particular rules and values that organize people, although the ethos can vary from group to group. For example, in some cultures
               individual rights might be highly valued, while in others the good of the community as a whole might be considered more important. The Greek
               root word ethos is related to ‚Äúethics‚Äù and refers to moral character. In rhetoric, an appeal to ethos means that a speaker attempts to persuade
               the audience that she is authoritative and credible.[0m
