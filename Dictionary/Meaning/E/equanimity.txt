[91m        SHORT  If you take the news of your parakeet's death with equanimity, it means you take it calmly without breaking down. Equanimity refers to emotional calmness and
               balance in times of stress.[0m
[36m         LONG  If equanimity reminds you of equal, that's because the words have a lot in common. The noun equanimity was borrowed from Latin aequanimitās, from aequanimus
               "even-tempered, fair," formed from aequus "even, level, equal" plus animus "mind." The archaic phrase to bear with equal mind means "to bear
               with a calm mind," and is a translation from the Latin. The phrase a level mind also refers to calmness. A near synonym is composure.[0m
