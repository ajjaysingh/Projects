[91m        SHORT  An enclave is a separate space or group within a larger one. Imagine an enclave as a cave carved out of a big mountain. All of the bears live in the cave or

[36m         LONG  Groups of like people often form an enclave within a country or region. There is probably an enclave of Africans, Cubans, Russians, or other ethnic group in
               or near your hometown. It isn't usually enclosed, but it's a place where people of the same background gather and live together, such as a
               Chinatown or a Little Budapest. An enclave of a country may have boundaries, making it clear that it's a distinct part â€” and sometimes under
               separate government â€” from the larger territory it's within.[0m
