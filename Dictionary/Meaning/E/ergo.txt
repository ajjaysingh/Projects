[91m        SHORT  The adverb ergo is a fancy version of  "therefore."  Use it as a connector between thoughts and sentences that logically follow.  You were present during the
               robbery; ergo, you were called as a witness.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ergo appeared in late Middle English meaning "therefore," probably from the Old Latin root regere, "to guide." You can see the relation to the word as it is
               used today, to present a connection between ideas where a second sentence or idea is "guided" by, or draws a logical conclusion from the first
               one. Satirist Jonathan Swift once wrote, ‚ÄúWords are but wind; and learning is nothing but words; ergo, learning is nothing but wind.‚Äù[0m
