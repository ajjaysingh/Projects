[91m        SHORT  Envious is another way to say jealous or resentful — in other words, you want what someone else has, whether it's charming good looks or the last chocolate
               frosted donut.[0m
[36m         LONG  Once upon a time, envious meant “eager to emulate.” Now a days this adjective is used to describe covetous feelings or a state of painful desire. Envious
               usually isn't a good thing to be; it's better to let it go and be happy with what you've got. Just remember the words of the wise Greek
               philosopher Antisthenes: "As iron is eaten away by rust, so the envious are consumed by their own passion."[0m
