[91m        SHORT  If there's one song on your playlist that always brings tears to your eyes, maybe it's because it has an elegiac quality. Elegiac means "mournful or sad."[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective elegiac is useful when you're talking about music, a movie, a book, or another work of art that has a sorrowful tone. Sometimes elegiac
               specifically refers to something or someone that's gone: a person who's died, or a time in the past, especially if you feel a sense of longing
               for it. You can speak in an elegiac way, or sing an elegiac tune. The word comes from the Greek elegos, "poem or song of lament."[0m
