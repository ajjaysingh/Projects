[91m        SHORT  When you really want to do something right, really nail it, really get at what you were going for — you're trying to be efficacious, or produce the effect you
               intended.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word efficacious is made up of the Latin efficere meaning "accomplish" and the suffix -ious meaning "full of." Something that's efficacious is full of
               accomplishment. An efficacious medicine is one that cures you of the ailment you had. An efficacious recipe is one that comes out the way you
               intended it to taste. Remember that efficacious has two fs and two cs in it and you'll be efficacious in your spelling of the word.[0m
