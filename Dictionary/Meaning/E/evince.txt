[35m                                         EVINCE                                         [0m
[91m        SHORT  The verb evince means to show or express clearly; to make plain.
               Evidence can evince the innocence of the accused, and
               tears can evince the grief of the mourning.[0m
[36m         LONG  Evince is a rather formal word that reveals the presence of
               something hidden ‚Äî usually a feeling. So, if you are
               happy, your smile might evince your happiness. And if
               you are angry, the skull and crossbones on your tee
               shirt might evince your anger. Evincing is about
               expressing. If you are keeping your feelings inside,
               there's not a lot of evincing going on.[0m
