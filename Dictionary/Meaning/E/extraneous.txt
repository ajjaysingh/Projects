[91m        SHORT  Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous can also mean not
               relevant or essential, like all the extraneous information in your long-winded science report.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary "outside the ordinary," or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus pointsâ€“â€“ding! ding!â€“â€“if you
               knew that terra is Latin for "earth.") The meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come from the outside: extraneous
               details are ones that don't matter.[0m
