                                                                                      ENTAIL                                                                                      
  SHORT        Entail means what something involves. "The job entailed us standing in the snow for hours dressed as giant, human hot dogs. It entailed far too much
               humiliation to justify the $3.55 an hour we were paid."
  LONG         The word entail is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want something, you better figure out what it entails. If we want to see the movie at 9
               o'clock, that will entail us waiting in the lobby another hour. If we want to stay out of trouble with our moms, that will entail us calling
               them and letting them know we're going to be later than we said.
                                                                            EXAMPLES FROM VOCABULARY:                                                                             
     >         And nothing can quite match a face-to-face meeting, with all the surprises that entails.
     >         “I want to be able to tell a story with these photos, and show people what the project entails.”
     >         In the 90s, being a hipster entailed wearing horn-rimmed glasses and sweaters while listening to Pavement.
     >         The firm, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, said those figures were “adjusted,” but didn’t specify what that entailed.
     >         And because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of himself, it seems a Christian act, a loss of self for others’ sake.
