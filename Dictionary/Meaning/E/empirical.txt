[36m         LONG  Empirical looks like empire comes from a completely different origin: it is from the Greek empeirikos, meaning experienced. It was originally used in medicine
               for doctors making choices based on observation and experiment rather than theoretical ideas. It's now used for any kind of knowledge that
               comes from experience. Meditate all day on the origins of donuts, but until you visit the donut bakery you'll lack empirical knowledge of donut
               creation.[0m
