[91m        SHORT  When you feel embarrassment, you are self-conscious or ashamed. Embarrassment might keep you from wearing your Statue of Liberty Halloween costume in public.[0m
[36m         LONG  Something that makes you blush — like when ten people rush up to tell you how great your tuba solo was or realizing that you left the house in your pajama
               bottoms — causes you embarrassment. The person or thing that makes you feel awkward and ashamed can also be described as an embarrassment. To
               avoid embarrassment, remember to double the r's and s's when you spell embarrassment.[0m
