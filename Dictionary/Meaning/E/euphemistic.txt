[91m        SHORT  Something that's euphemistic fills in, in a polite or gentle way, for a difficult or offensive word. A euphemistic way to say "pregnant," for example, is "in
               the family way."[0m
[36m         LONG  People often use euphemistic expressions when they're afraid of offending or upsetting someone. You might refer to pornography as "adult material," or instead
               of saying, "You're going bald," say "You're looking a little thin on top." Euphemism comes from the Greek euphemismos, "use of a favorable word
               in place of an inauspicious one," from the roots eu-, "good," and pheme, "speaking."[0m
