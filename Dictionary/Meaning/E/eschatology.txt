[91m        SHORT  What happens after death? We won't try to give an answer (even if we had one) here. But if you're interested in exploring this question, you're interested in
               eschatology ‚Äî the part of theology that has to do with death or the end of the world.[0m
[36m         LONG  Eschatology comes from the Greek eskhatos, meaning "last," which makes sense given that this branch of theology is preoccupied with the study of the last part
               of life or death. More specifically, eschatology involves four elements or "last" things: death, judgment, heaven and hell. It's an examination
               of the ultimate destiny of mankind.[0m
