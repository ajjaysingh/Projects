[91m        SHORT  To endeavour is to strive for something. The endeavour itself is the thing you're striving for, the enterprise or undertaking. It's a primarily British
               spelling of the word.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Middle English root of endeavour means to "put oneself in" or "do one's utmost," so if you endeavour to do something, you do it with earnestness and a
               fair amount of effort. Americans usually spell the word endeavor, but NASA named one of its space shuttles the Endeavour. Why the extra "u"?
               NASA was honoring the HMS Endeavour, the first ship ever used by the British explorer Captain James Cook.[0m
