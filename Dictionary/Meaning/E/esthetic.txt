[91m        SHORT  Often you can tell a person's esthetic, or sense of what she thinks is beautiful, by stepping into her home and seeing how it's decorated.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word esthetic is also spelled aesthetic, so don't be confused if you see it written both ways. It's a word to describe someone's idea of what is
               beautiful. Do you have a modern esthetic or a classic esthetic? If you like the way something appears, you think it has an esthetic appearance.
               If you like to think about what makes art good, then you are interested in esthetic philosophy.[0m
