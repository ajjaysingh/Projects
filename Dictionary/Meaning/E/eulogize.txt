[91m        SHORT  To eulogize someone is to talk about how much you respect and admire them, especially as a memorial after their death. At funerals, sometimes several people
               eulogize the deceased person.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can eulogize a living person ‚Äî particularly if she has retired from a job ‚Äî or even a place or a group. You might eulogize your elementary school after
               it's been closed, or eulogize the coach of your basketball team after she's left for a job in another town. The verb eulogize comes from
               eulogy, a speech that praises, from the Greek root eulogia, "praise" or "fine language," from eu, "well," and -logia, "speaking."[0m
