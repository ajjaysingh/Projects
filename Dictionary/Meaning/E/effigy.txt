  SHORT        In modern usage, effigy most often refers to a likeness, such as a dummy, that is hanged, burned, or otherwise abused when protesting the despised person's
               actions.
  LONG         If you've encountered the phrase "in effigy,” it's probably been in a news report about protesters burning a stuffed figure made to look like a loathed
               corporate leader or head of state. Since the 18th century or longer, effigies have been destroyed in place of individuals who, as far as the
               angry crowd is concerned, have escaped justice. Effigy can also refer to a sculptural portrait of the deceased reclining upon a burial
               monument.
