[91m        SHORT  A witty remark is clever and funny and timed just right. When you make such a remark, you are also considered to be witty.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective witty can be used to describe those quick little funny remarks that often demonstrate a sharp, biting humor delivered in a playful manner. Witty
               usually describes things that are off-the-cuff amusing, rather than remarks that are elaborate or carefully planned in advance. This adjective
               is usually used in a complimentary way, but, like its cousin clever, it can be used sarcastically, as when someone who doesn't appreciate your
               one-liners says, "Well, aren't we witty today."[0m
