[91m        SHORT  A wound is a serious injury, especially a deep cut through the skin. But things like pride and feelings can also get wounded.[0m
[36m         LONG  Wounds are serious: we're talking a lot worse than just a scrape or booboo. Just about all the meanings of this word have to do with being hurt. If you got
               stabbed, you got a stab wound. Soldiers in battle get a lot of wounds from enemies. If someone told you to shut up, they might wound your
               feelings. If you slipped in a puddle in front of your friends, that might wound your pride.[0m
