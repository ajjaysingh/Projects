[36m         LONG  You don't just have to wield something physical; you can also wield or exert influence or authority. Wield is frequently followed by the word power. If you
               were a king, you could wield great power in your kingdom ‚Äî exerting your influence over everything from food rations to castle upkeep. As it
               is, though, you might just wield power over your pet goldfish. Note: wield follows the i before e, except after c spelling rule.[0m
