[91m        SHORT  To waive is to give up one's right to do something. If you waive your right to help name your family's new puppy, you can't complain if he ends up being
               called "Mr. Tinkerbell Sweetheart Lovey-Face."[0m
[36m         LONG  Waive comes from a Middle English word meaning to abandon; the word waif, which refers to a neglected or orphaned child, shares the same root. However, while
               abandoning a child on a street corner is not okay, waiving one's right to do something is in most cases perfectly acceptable.  A document
               stating one's decision to give up one's rights is appropriately called a waiver.[0m
