[91m        SHORT  If you are ever served with a writ, then you better do what it says. A writ is a written document issuing a legal order.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word writ has been around since before the twelfth century and was first used to describe a written document needed to have a case heard at the royal
               courts of England during the Middle Ages. Nowadays, the king is most likely no longer involved, but this word still refers to a legal document
               issued by a court of law. A writ contains a written order instructing someone to do something or to stop doing something. If you ever need to
               give out a writ, remember that the verb to serve is typically used to describe the issuing of a writ — as in “Tony was served with a writ on
               Monday.”[0m
