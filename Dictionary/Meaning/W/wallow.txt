[91m        SHORT  To wallow is to roll about in something, as a pig wallows in mud or a billionaire wallows in money.[0m
[36m         LONG  Wallow can be used to describe a physical action or an emotional state. If you cry "Woe is me!" one too many times, you might be accused of wallowing in self-
               pity. Because of its association with the much-maligned pig, wallow often has a negative, insulting tone. So, rather than wallowing in that
               pile of money once you've won the lottery, try bathing or wading in it instead.[0m
