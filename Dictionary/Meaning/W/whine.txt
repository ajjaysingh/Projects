[36m         LONG  Whine is both a noun and a verb. The verb means "to complain bitterly." Kids tend to cry or even yell when they whine, though most adults settle for constant
               griping and an unwillingness to let it go already.  "Poor me" and "It isn't fair" — these are common whines. Whine can describe a high-pitched,
               screeching noise, like the squeak made by an old, broken machine.[0m
