[91m        SHORT  Whimsy is what a person who's a dreamer and out of step with the real world might have lots of. People who are full of whimsy are odd, but often fanciful and
               lovely, like Harry Potter's friend Luna Lovegood.[0m
[36m         LONG  Whimsy is also a whim ‚Äî something you do just because you want to. If you find a postcard of Alaska and take that as a reason to move there, that could
               qualify as whimsy. Whimsy is irrational, but playful. If you decorate your house with whimsy, you may have a wall decorated with butterflies
               and giant daisies with googly eyes, and a couch trimmed with peacock feathers and vinyl. It's amusing and witty, and you‚Äôre a master of whimsy.[0m
