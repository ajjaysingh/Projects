[36m         LONG  It's a noun! It's a verb! It's a word that warrants our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of paper they show you through the keyhole during an
               investigation. It's also a reason for doing something, or a promise (think of the warranty on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a
               certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such when the ticking suitcase warrants bringing
               in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in late again warrants a stricter curfew.[0m
