[91m        SHORT  Things that are a total loss ‚Äî really worthless or damaging ‚Äî are dross. That gunk between your teeth that comes out when you floss? You could call that
               dross. No one wants it, and it's harmful if it stays.[0m
[36m         LONG  While dross is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or useless, like the nonmetallic stuff left when metal gets refined, it's also used for people and
               forms of art. A really bad movie can be called dross, and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or trash, is another form of dross.
