[36m         LONG  Desperate, desparate, or despirate? The word desperate is misspelled often enough that it's the despair of English teachers. Both desperate and despair come
               from the same Latin verb as despair. Don't mix it up with disparate, a totally different word that means "distinctive, different, various."[0m
