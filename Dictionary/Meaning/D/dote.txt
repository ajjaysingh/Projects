[91m        SHORT  Who doesn't love to have someone dote on them? If you dote on someone, you shower them with love and attention. Sounds like the life![0m
[36m         LONG  Parents that dote on their children too much might find themselves in trouble down the road; all that unadulterated devotion is a surefire way to spoil your
               kid. The problem is that those who are doing the doting are often too smitten to see when the object of their affection is acting like a
               complete jerk. No wonder dote is related to a German word that means "to be foolish." That connection might also explain the use of dote to
               mean acting senile in one's later years.[0m
