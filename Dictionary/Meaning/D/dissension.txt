[91m        SHORT  You can use the noun dissension for situations where people just can't agree or get along. There is often dissension between labor unions and governments

[36m         LONG  A dissension is a disagreement, or difference of opinion, and the meaning hasn't changed since the word first came into use in French in about the 12th
