[91m        SHORT  When you think of the word destitute, which means poor or lacking other necessities of life, think of someone who is in desperate straits. A very, very tight
               budget is poor. Living on the streets is destitute.[0m
[36m         LONG  Destitute essentially means not having something. When you're destitute in the sense of being poor, you're technically "destitute of money." You can be
               destitute of other things as well. If all your friends have abandoned you, you're "destitute of friends." If you are applying for a job as a
               waitress but have never worked in a restaurant in any capacity, you're "destitute of experience."[0m
