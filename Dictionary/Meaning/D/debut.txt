[91m        SHORT  A debut is a first appearance, a launch, or public introduction. So before you make your big debut at the office, check and make sure you don't have spinach
               in your teeth.[0m
[36m         LONG  Perhaps you’ve heard of debutantes making their official debut into society, or actresses and actors making their debut on stage. A fun fact: debut and
               premiere are often thought to be interchangeable, but they’re not. A debut, as you now know, is a first public appearance. But a premiere,
               while also a “first,” isn't necessarily live. When a movie opens or an interview is broadcast for the first time, they're called premieres.[0m
