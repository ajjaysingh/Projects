[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective de jure to describe something that exists legally, like a law which specifies that companies can't discriminate against disabled people when
               they're hiring workers.[0m
[36m         LONG  The phrase de jure is often used to emphasize the opposite of de facto, which means "by fact, or "by practice." For example, de facto practices at companies
               are sometimes discriminatory despite de jure regulations against those practices. The Latin phrase literally means "of law," and it's been used
               since the 1600s to mean "legitimate or legal," especially by those in the legal profession.[0m
