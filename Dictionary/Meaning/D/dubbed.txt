  SHORT        If your brother is obsessive about doing the laundry, then you might dub him the "Scion of the Spin Cycle" or the "Dean of Detergent," meaning you’ve given
               him a funny nickname that’s inspired by his personal quirks.
  LONG         The verb dub traces back to the French word adober, meaning “equip with armor,” and originally referred to making someone a knight. Dub still carries that
               meaning, although now it's more likely to describe the giving out of titles of a different kind. Use this word when you give someone a playful
               nickname or an unofficial title based on some notable characteristic the person has, like dubbing your sister the "Queen of Shoes."

     >         Some former pilots have dubbed their service the “geriatric Air Force.”
     >         Specifically, I found freedom behind the wheel of a hand-me-down, pewter-gray Chevy Nova, which my buddies and I dubbed the “Grey Ghost.”
     >         The home, dubbed Coleman Cottage, is now at Wellston Park, where it will serve as office and meeting space for the new park.
