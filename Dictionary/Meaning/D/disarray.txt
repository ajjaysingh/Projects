                                                                                     DISARRAY                                                                                     
  SHORT        If something is confused or disorganized, use the noun disarray, like the disarray that follows your little brother everywhere he goes because he spills
               everything and never puts away his toys.
  LONG         Combine the prefix dis-, meaning “lack of,” with array, which derives from the Old French word areer ("to put in order"), and... you’ve got a mess on your
               hands — or a lack of order. That's disarray. Whether it’s your plans, your kitchen, your workplace, or your hair, the noun disarray can be used
               to describe anything that is characterized by disorder, untidiness, or confusion.
