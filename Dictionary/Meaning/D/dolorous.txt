[91m        SHORT  Dolorous is not a woman's name (that's Dolores), it is an adjective that describes someone showing great sadness. If your friend Dolores is crying about a
               lost puppy, you could call her dolorous Dolores.[0m
[36m         LONG  Music written in a minor key can have a dolorous effect. It sounds really sad, and can make you feel the same way. Dolorous shares the same root with the
               word, condolence, an expression of sympathy with someone's sadness. Both of these words come from the Latin word for grief, dolor, which in
               current Spanish happens to mean pain.[0m
