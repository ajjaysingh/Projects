                                                                                     DISDAIN                                                                                      
  SHORT        If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may disdain it (or treat it with disdain).
  LONG         In Old French, deignier meant "to treat something as worthy." To disdain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: "Management at [the company] displayed
               a certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization." As a verb, disdain carries an air
               of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like despise, abhor, detest, loathe and scorn. So if you disdain something, you might
               reject it with a haughty scoff, "Ha!"
