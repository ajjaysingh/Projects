[91m        SHORT  Delinquency is a minor crime, especially one committed by a youth. Cutting class all week to drive around town without your license is a sure sign of
               delinquency.[0m
[36m         LONG  Delinquency can mean a particular violation, like stealing a car, but it may also refer to a more general trend of acting out and violating the law, like
               stealing cars daily and crashing them many times over. In this sense it‚Äôs often called juvenile delinquency. Another sense of delinquency is
               general neglect, particularly by someone who holds a formal position. The word can also refer to an unpaid debt. You‚Äôre thinking about those
               unpaid library fines now, right?[0m
