[91m        SHORT  When you badmouth someone or talk scornfully about them (especially when they don't deserve it), that's denigration. If you practice denigration, shame on
               you![0m
[36m         LONG  It's one thing to criticize people fairly, but when it's done in an unfair or unnecessarily hateful way, it's not criticism — it's denigration. The
               denigration of a public political figure is bad enough, but the denigration of ordinary people because of their religious beliefs, sexual
               orientation, or body size, for example, can even be illegal. Denigration is rooted in the Latin denigrare, meaning "to blacken."[0m
