[91m        SHORT  It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly innocuous question, like "Do you like hot dogs?" and she unleashes a diatribe about the evils of
               eating meat. A diatribe is an angry, critical speech.[0m
[36m         LONG  This noun has its roots in the Greek diatribƒì, "pastime or lecture," from diatrƒ´bein, "to waste time or wear away," combining dia-, "thoroughly," and trƒ´bein,
               "to rub." So the origin of the word diatribe is connected to both serious study and the spending or wasting of time. With most diatribes, the
               speaker thinks he's well informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that
               it's just a waste of time.[0m
