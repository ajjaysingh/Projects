[36m         LONG  First appearing in Middle English, the noun dalliance stems from the verb dally, meaning "to waste time, to act playfully, especially in a flirtatious way."
               Dalliance often describes a casual flirtation ‚Äî generally something short-term and not very serious. Your aunt may blush when you mention her
