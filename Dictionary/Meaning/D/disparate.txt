[91m        SHORT  The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very
               different from each other.[0m
[36m         LONG  Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin disparƒÅtus, from disparƒÅre "to separate, divide," from the prefix dis- "apart"
               plus parƒÅre "to prepare." Disparate in the sense of "very different" probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar
               "unequal, different."[0m
