[91m        SHORT  The verb deride means to show a low opinion of someone or something. The jerk would deride the other kids on the bus by calling them names or pulling their
               hair until the driver decided to de-ride him by kicking him off the bus.[0m
[36m         LONG  To "ride" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes
               from the Latin root dƒìrƒ´dƒìre, meaning "to ridicule, to scorn," and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something
               with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns.[0m
