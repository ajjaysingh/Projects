      Origin:  Old English dott ‚Äòhead of a boil‚Äô. The word is recorded only once in Old English, then not until the late 16th century, when it is found in the sense ‚Äòa small
               lump or clot‚Äô, perhaps influenced by Dutch dot ‚Äòa knot‚Äô. The sense ‚Äòsmall mark or spot‚Äô dates from the mid 17th century.
