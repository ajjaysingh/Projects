[91m        SHORT  When you are in charge of something or rule it, you have dominion over it. The most famous use of the word occurs in the Christian Bible, when God grants
               people dominion over other animals.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you know the word domination, then you won't be surprised that dominion also has to do with a type of ruling over others. This is an old-fashioned and
               Biblical-sounding word for having power. A king has dominion over his kingdom. You'd never say the President has dominion, because we live in a
               democracy. Dominion implies more power than that ‚Äî even absolute power. A dominion can also be an area or territory controlled by a larger
               country or state.[0m
