[36m         LONG  If you damage your reputation or dishonor your family in some way, you've fallen into disrepute. The noun is especially useful for describing the loss of
               esteem for a group, team, or organization: "The scandal sent the entire sport of kickboxing into disrepute." It stems from repute, the general
               opinion or reputation of something, which comes directly from the Latin word repute.[0m
