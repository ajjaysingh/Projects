                                                                                     DISGORGE                                                                                     
  SHORT        There's really no way to put this delicately. Disgorge is just a fancy word for "puke." You know... "Barf." "Spew." "Upchuck." Usually applied to birds or
               animals rather than people.
  LONG         Okay, actually that's not entirely true. Disgorge also has the other broader, metaphorical meanings of "emptying out," as in: "the bus began to disgorge its
               passengers;" or "he finally began to disgorge his secrets." So, actually, yes, it does mean a lot more than just "puke." Sorry.
