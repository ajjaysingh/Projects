[36m         LONG  A domino is a small, black rectangular game piece with white dots. In the game called dominoes, sides of the dominoes with equal numbers are matched. Dominoes
               are also stood up to create elaborate patterns that look pretty impressive when they‚Äôre knocked down. If you set them up right, knocking down
               the first domino will knock down hundreds and even thousands of others. This use of dominoes inspired the domino effect, when one action
               inevitably causes others.[0m
