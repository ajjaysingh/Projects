[36m         LONG  Dearth is an Old English noun formed from the adjective deore, "precious, costly," and the noun-forming suffix -th. Though the relationship of dearth meaning
               "lack, insufficient amount" to the adjective dear is not so obvious, it is still easy to imagine that something precious is probably also in
               short supply. Dearth is used almost exclusively in the phrase "a dearth of."[0m
