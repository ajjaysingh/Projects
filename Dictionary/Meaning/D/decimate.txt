[91m        SHORT  If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. "The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife

[36m         LONG  The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in
               decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the
               word decimate its "drastically reduced" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean "to wipe out" or "to eliminate."[0m
