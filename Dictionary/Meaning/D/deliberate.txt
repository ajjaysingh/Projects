  SHORT        To deliberate means to carefully think or talk something through — it also means slow and measured, the pace of this kind of careful decision making. If you
               chose deliberately, you make a very conscious, well-thought-through choice.
  LONG         The verb deliberate ends with an "ate" sound — at the end of a trial, after the evidence is presented, the twelve members of a jury retreat to a room to
               deliberate, i.e., talk through the trial and come to a verdict. The adjective deliberate ends with an "it" sound. If you walk with a deliberate
               pace, you're slow and steady.
