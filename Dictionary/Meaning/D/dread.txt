[91m        SHORT  The noun dread describes the fear of something bad happening, like the dread you feel when walking alone on a deserted street in the dark.[0m
[36m         LONG  Dread is a feeling of fear, but it can also be the desire to avoid something. For example, many people feel dread at the very thought of speaking in front of
               an audience. As a verb, dread means "to fear or not want something to happen," like students who did not study and as a result, dread getting
               their graded tests back. As an adjective, dread means "frightening or terrifying," like a dread monster.[0m
