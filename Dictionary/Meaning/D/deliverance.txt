[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre seeking deliverance, you want to be set free or removed from a bad situation. If you're taken hostage in a bank heist, you might pray for
               deliverance.[0m
[36m         LONG  You probably notice that deliver makes up a big chunk of deliverance. One meaning of deliver is ‚Äúto set free‚Äù ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what deliverance is: the act of
               setting someone free. Deliverance often has religious connotations, but the word can be used for other kinds of rescue or liberation. You might
               want deliverance from the hardship of working on your uncle‚Äôs farm all summer, or at least deliverance from the smell of manure.[0m
