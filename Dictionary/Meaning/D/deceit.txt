[36m         LONG  Deceit comes from the Latin for "cheat." When you deceive someone, you give them a false impression, mislead them so as to get away with something bad. If a
               person speaks in a way that gives a false impression, we call the way he speaks "deceptive." If someone pretends to be someone else, that‚Äôs an
               act of deceit, like when a thief pretends to be a valet parking attendant and takes off with your car.[0m
