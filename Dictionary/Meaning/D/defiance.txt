                                               DEFIANCE                                               
  SHORT        Stand up when the powers that be order you to sit down, and you've given a fine
               example of defiance. It happens when someone or a group of someones
               openly flouts or challenges authority.
  LONG         We owe this lovely descriptive term to the French — specifically to the Old French
               word defier, which means to defy. (Don't mix it up with deify; that
               means to make someone or something into a god.) If you've ever
               studied Latin, you'll spot the fi from fidare "to trust" that
               inspired the Marines' "semper fi" motto and the popular moniker for
               pooches––"Fido." Combining fi with de- negates it. So an act of
               defiance is essentially an act of not trusting.

     >         According to Amnesty International, the Bangladeshi government has begun forcibly
               repatriating the asylum seekers by the thousands, in defiance of
               international law.
     >         That’s easy enough to understand, but how do we apply the idea of a consequence if
               you are seeing defiance in your home?
     >         As part of the BBC's 100 Women season, we meet a woman engaged in small acts of
               defiance.
     >         The provocative injection of the Islamic State, a rival of the Taliban, has
               generated both fear and defiance among local Shiites.
     >         Donald Trump’s victory inspired another, less noted reaction that may prove more
               politically significant than the current wave of demoralization:
               defiance.
