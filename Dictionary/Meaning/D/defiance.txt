[91m        SHORT  Stand up when the powers that be order you to sit down, and you've given a fine example of defiance. It happens when someone or a group of someones openly
               flouts or challenges authority.[0m
[36m         LONG  We owe this lovely descriptive term to the French ‚Äî specifically to the Old French word defier, which means to defy. (Don't mix it up with deify; that means
               to make someone or something into a god.) If you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the fi from fidare "to trust" that inspired the Marines'
               "semper fi" motto and the popular moniker for pooches‚Äì‚Äì"Fido." Combining fi with de- negates it. So an act of defiance is essentially an act of
               not trusting.[0m
