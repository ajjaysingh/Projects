  SHORT        Despotism is a way of ruling in which the leader has total, unchecked power. Joseph Stalin purged the Soviet Union of all his opponents in order to rule the
               country through despotism. He didn’t have many friends.
  LONG         Despotism can also describe tyranny, the wielding of power through cruelty and terror. It's often used in reference to a country that's ruled by a dictator,
               but despotism can describe any situation characterized by oppression and threats. When your sister threatens to send all of your friends
               embarrassing baby photos of you if you don’t let her control the TV remote, that’s despotism.

     >         “Victims of despotism are entitled to fairness and justice, and this is the message we are conveying to the whole world.”
     >         It’s an idea that “advocates of democracy, and other enemies of despotism, will want to resist,” he wrote, and he counted himself among the resisters.
     >         It was also a way for Clinton to avoid appearing soft on Middle Eastern despotism.
     >         To go down that road is to take a shortcut to despotism and repression.
