[91m        SHORT  Despotism is a way of ruling in which the leader has total, unchecked power. Joseph Stalin purged the Soviet Union of all his opponents in order to rule the
               country through despotism. He didn‚Äôt have many friends.[0m
[36m         LONG  Despotism can also describe tyranny, the wielding of power through cruelty and terror. It's often used in reference to a country that's ruled by a dictator,
               but despotism can describe any situation characterized by oppression and threats. When your sister threatens to send all of your friends
               embarrassing baby photos of you if you don‚Äôt let her control the TV remote, that‚Äôs despotism.[0m
