[36m         LONG  Devious sometimes just describes a path that is not direct, a meaning that can be traced to the Latin adjective devius "out of the way," formed from the
               prefix de- "off" plus via "way, road." The related English verb deviate means to do something different or unexpected, and the adjective
               deviant describes behavior that is not considered normal or morally correct.[0m
