[91m        SHORT  A young, unmarried woman is a damsel. If you've ever seen a young girl being chased by a rabid dog, then you've witnessed a damsel in distress![0m
[36m         LONG  The word damsel is a shortened version of the French word, mademoiselle, which is what the French call a young woman who is not married ‚Äî like the word miss
               in English. Damsel was originally a word reserved for noblewomen ‚Äî the rich and fabulous. Nowadays even regular unmarried Janes can be referred
               to as damsel, though you're really most likely to come across the word damsel being rescued by a prince in a fairytale.[0m
