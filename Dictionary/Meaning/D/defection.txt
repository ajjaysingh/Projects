[91m        SHORT  Is your team so bad you have begun supporting a rival team? Then you're guilty of defection ‚Äî the act of shifting your support to a new cause.[0m
[36m         LONG  Most people won't thank you for your defection. No matter how much you might believe in the new sports team, or political party, or whatever, defection is
               generally used as a critical term. Defection implies a lack of character ‚Äî as you can tell by looking at its Latin roots, which come from the
               word defectionum, meaning "desertion, revolt, failure." Clearly, no one likes a defector.[0m
