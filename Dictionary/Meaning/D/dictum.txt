[91m        SHORT  "You are what you eat" is a dictum, and so is a law requiring you to curb your dog. A dictum is a formal pronouncement, a rule, or a statement that expresses
               a truth universally acknowledged.[0m
[36m         LONG  Dictum dates from the 16th Century. It descended from a Latin word that means "something said." In contemporary use, it means more like "something that is
               officially said." If the principal of your school issues a dictum declaring "no jeans in school," it's time to go shopping.[0m
