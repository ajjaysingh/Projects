[91m        SHORT  Someone's disposition is their mood or general attitude about life. If your friend woke up on the wrong side of the bed, tell her that she might need a
               disposition makeover.[0m
[36m         LONG  Disposition means the positive or negative way a person views the world. In contrast, your character is determined by your inner moral values, and your
               personality reflects what you're like as an individual. An animal with an excellent disposition is friendly towards people. If you are
               cheerful, you're often said to have a sunny disposition. Disposition can also mean "getting rid of something," so cleaning your room might
               involve the disposition of empty pizza boxes and soda cans.[0m
