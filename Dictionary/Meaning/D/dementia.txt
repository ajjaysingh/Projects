[36m         LONG  Although dementia is most common in elderly people, it's not a normal part of growing older but a syndrome caused by brain disease or injury. Dementia gets
               its name from the Latin words de, or "without," and mens, or "mind," which join together to mean "madness," although in English, dementia is
               not the same thing as madness. One example of an illness that causes dementia is Alzheimer's disease.[0m
