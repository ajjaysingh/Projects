[36m         LONG  Dapper is a Germanic word coming from the Middle Dutch word for elegant. Think of the words dashing, jaunty and spiffy when you think of dapper as these are
               all near synonyms. All of these words are used specifically to describe men. Although there doesn't seem to be a parallel term for a well-
               dressed woman, if you call her chic or stylish, she will be pleased.[0m
