[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective disingenuous to describe behavior that's not totally honest or sincere. It's disingenuous when people pretend to know less about something
               than they really do.[0m
[36m         LONG  Disingenuous combines dis-, meaning not, with ingenuous (from the Latin gen-, meaning born) which was originally used to distinguish free-born Romans from
               slaves, and later came to mean honest or straightforward. So disingenuous means dishonest. Ingenuous is less common now than disingenuous, but
               we still use it for someone who is sincere to the point of naiveté.  A good synonym is insincere.[0m
