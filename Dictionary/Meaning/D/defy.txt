[36m         LONG  If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or resist, that rule. The word defy comes from the Latin word disfidare for "renounce one's
               faith." So if you're expected to be faithful to a certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it. There are different ways to defy ‚Äî
