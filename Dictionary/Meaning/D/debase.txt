[91m        SHORT  To debase something is to make it corrupt or impure. If your lemonade stand sells ‚Äúpure lemonade,‚Äù you‚Äôd insist on using real lemons instead of a mix; using a

[36m         LONG  Debase is often used in the context of two things: coins and people. To debase a coin is to replace some of the precious metal in the coin with metal of
               lesser value. To debase a person is to corrupt them, often by driving them to perform an immoral act like (gasp!) using the lemonade mix. Just
               promise us you won‚Äôt do it.[0m
