[91m        SHORT  A disjunction is a broken connection. If you expect to be a doctor but you haven't taken any science courses since high school biology, you would have a
               disjunction between your expectations and your training.[0m
[36m         LONG  The -junct- in disjunction is the same Latin root that gives us yoke, the harness that joins two oxen together. So if you have a disjunction, things are not
               joined together — there's a disconnect. If you order a pizza and the waiter brings you caviar, that's a disjunction. In logic, a disjunction is
               made by joining two sentences with "or" — "I'm tired, or I'm hungry" — while a conjunction joins two sentences with "and" — "I'm tired, and I'm
               hungry."[0m
