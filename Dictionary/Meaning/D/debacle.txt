[91m        SHORT  Use debacle to refer to a fiasco, disaster, or great failure. If several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping players and chewing up
               the bases, you can call the whole event a debacle.[0m
[36m         LONG  Debacle is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up huddled in a
               valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors‚Äì‚Äìthat's a debacle. Debacle comes
               from French d√©b√¢cler "to clear," from Middle French desbacler, from the prefix des- "completely, utterly" plus bacler "to block."[0m
