[91m        SHORT  A dovetail is a joint in woodworking where two sides are fitted together with interlocking pieces. You can also use the word dovetail to show how other things
               fit well together ‚Äî like how your picnic plans nicely dovetail with the sunny forecast.[0m
[36m         LONG  A well-made dovetail is a beautiful thing, with wooden projections that slide into notches perfectly, the two sides forming a corner. When things fit this
               way, you can say they dovetail ‚Äî they fit easily and work well together. Your plan to dress up as a Jedi knight dovetails well with your
               brother's Darth Vader costume, for example. Dovetails got their name from the tail feather-like shape of the joint's pieces.[0m
