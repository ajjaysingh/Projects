[91m        SHORT  If your brother is obsessive about doing the laundry, then you might dub him the "Scion of the Spin Cycle" or the "Dean of Detergent," meaning you’ve given
               him a funny nickname that’s inspired by his personal quirks.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb dub traces back to the French word adober, meaning “equip with armor,” and originally referred to making someone a knight. Dub still carries that
               meaning, although now it's more likely to describe the giving out of titles of a different kind. Use this word when you give someone a playful
               nickname or an unofficial title based on some notable characteristic the person has, like dubbing your sister the "Queen of Shoes."[0m

      Origin:  late Old English (in the sense ‘make a knight’): from Old French adober ‘equip with armour’, of unknown origin. Sense 2 is from the obsolete meaning ‘dress or
               adorn’.
