                                                                                     DESPITE                                                                                      
  SHORT        Despite is used as a preposition when something happens even though it might have been prevented by something else. You might go see a movie despite hearing a
               review calling it worse than "Showgirls" and "Ishtar" combined.
  LONG         Despite is just one letter away from despise, and they actually share a root: the Latin verb despicere, meaning "to look down on scornfully." Despite came to
               mean "contempt" or "scorn" in English, though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase "in despite of" gradually got
               shortened to the preposition despite and lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something despite the obstacles in your way, there's no
               need to feel spiteful about it.

     >         But despite his precautions, the 32-year-old California man died Saturday while hunting with an uncle in Western Maryland.
     >         Despite countless attempts on both continents, he never managed to qualify for either a British or U.S.
     >         Despite her deep unpopularity throughout the campaign, no Democratic candidate for Senate ever tried to separate themselves from Clinton in any meaningful
               way.
     >         He said he doesnâ€™t feel safe, despite having his own scooter rather than using public transport.
     >         Mr. Trump should dismiss Mr. Cordray on his first day as President despite the appeal, but the bureau has other problems.
