[36m         LONG  You can influence someone's actions by promoting certain behaviors and discouraging others. And it's the discouragement part where deterrence comes in. A
               deterrence makes you reconsider doing something — usually bad things like stealing or skipping school — because you know the penalty will be
               harsh. Deterrences make you afraid to try something. So many homeowners hope that a security alarm will be a deterrence to burglars.[0m
