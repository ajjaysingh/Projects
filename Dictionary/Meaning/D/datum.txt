[91m        SHORT  One item of information, one fact, one statistic, is on its own a datum, the singular form of the more commonly used "data."  If you can't find one single
               datum to support your theory, it's time for another theory.[0m
[36m         LONG  Whereas several bits of information taken together are called data, one is a datum. The word comes from the Latin for "something given."  Datum is also used
               for a starting point of measurement, often used in surveying or engineering.  The single datum that your experiment provided was that you are
               tall, dark and handsome.  Now stop looking in the mirror and do some research.[0m
