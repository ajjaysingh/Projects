[36m         LONG  Dunderhead is a more colorful way to say "dummy" or "stupid." It's derogatory, but not the meanest word for someone making a really foolish move: "You
               dunderhead!" tends to sound a little bit amused. You might call a goofy kid a dunderhead, or call yourself a dunderhead when you make the same
               silly mistake over and over again. The origin isn't certain, though the dunder part may come from the Middle Dutch word donder, or "thunder."[0m
