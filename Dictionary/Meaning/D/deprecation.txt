	Wiki Definition:
              	In general English usage, the infinitive "to  deprecate " means "to express disapproval of (something)". It derives from the Latin verb deprecare,  meaning
               "to ward off (a disaster) by prayer". In current technical usage, for one to state that a feature is  deprecated  is merely a recommendation
               against using it.
