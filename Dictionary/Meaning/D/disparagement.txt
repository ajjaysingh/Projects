[36m         LONG  Disparagement comes from the Old French desparagier, meaning "marry someone of unequal rank." Disparagement is the act of speaking about someone in a negative
               or belittling way, and doesn't have to be related to weddings. If someone wins an election because of sneaky, dishonest ads, you can be sure
               that there will be plenty of disparagement of that candidate in the back rooms of the defeated politician.[0m
