[91m        SHORT  Decorum is proper and polite behavior. If you let out a big belch at a fancy dinner party, you're not showing much decorum.[0m
[36m         LONG  This noun is from Latin dec≈çrus "proper, becoming, handsome," from d√©cor "beauty, grace," which is also the source of English d√©cor. The corresponding
               adjective is decorous, meaning "well-behaved in a particular situation." Both decorum and decorous are often used to describe behavior in a
               classroom or courtroom.[0m
