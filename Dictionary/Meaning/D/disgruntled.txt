[91m        SHORT  Disgruntled sounds like what it is ‚Äî dissatisfied, grunting and grumbling. You could become a  disgruntled employee if your boss swipes all your best ideas
               without giving you credit (or a raise).[0m
[36m         LONG  Disgruntled actually comes from gruntle, an old verb meaning, not so surprisingly, "to grunt." When you're disgruntled, you might grunt with dissatisfaction
               and anger.  If you are a disgruntled customer, why not ask to speak to a manager? Unless you'd rather just stand there grunting.[0m
