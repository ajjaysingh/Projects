[91m        SHORT  In its simplest sense, descend means to go or move downward, but there are a couple of subtle variations on this theme. Yes, a bird can descend from the sky,
               but also, humans are descended from prehistoric ancestors.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you've ever heard a pilot say "prepare for our descent", then you know that only one letter separates the noun descent from the verb descend. They both
               derive from the same Latin components de, meaning "down," and scandere, "to climb." Similarly, if someone condescends to you, they are said,
               derogatorily, to be coming down to your level.    All Americans are descended from peoples from other continents, such as Europe, Africa, and
               Asia. We've all "come down" from our ancestors.[0m
