[91m        SHORT  If someone is docile, he is easily taught or handled. If you suddenly became a trouble-maker in class, your teachers would long for the days when you were
               sweet and docile.[0m
[36m         LONG  Docile comes from Latin root for teaching, docere, so someone docile is easy to teach. A docile student is willing to be taught.  A docile animal is easy to
               handle. If you behave well and do what people tell you to do, you're a docile person. Docile might be a word of praise, but it can also be a
               criticism of someone for being overly submissive. Some synonyms are amenable and compliant.[0m
