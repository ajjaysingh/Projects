[91m        SHORT  To deprecate is to show disapproval or to make someone feel unimportant by speaking to them disrespectfully, like seniors who deprecate younger students just
               for fun.[0m
[36m         LONG  To deprecate is to diminish, or to oppose, like when someone deprecates your dream of climbing Mt. Everest by calling it "a little walk up a hill." Some
               people deprecate themselves, which is called being self-deprecating. People who do are self-deprecating play down their abilities because they
               are humble ‚Äî or want to appear that way. So if you do climb Everest and you are self-deprecating, you'll say it wasn't such a big deal, even if
               it was the proudest moment of your life.[0m
