[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôve ever had to do the laundry, wash the dishes, make the meals, change the bedding, vacuum the house, and clean the bathrooms day after day, you‚Äôve
               experienced drudgery. Drudgery is hard, mindless, backbreaking work.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you say the word drudgery, you can almost feel the hard, plodding work that it describes. You have to put some effort into saying the dr- sound. Then, as
               soon as you get through the breathy -u-, you‚Äôve got two more hard sounds in -dg- and -er- before you get another break with the final vowel
               sound. Just as you might drag yourself doing those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag your way through pronouncing the word.[0m
