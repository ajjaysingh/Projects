[91m        SHORT  Feeling overwhelmed, like you're underwater? You might be experiencing a deluge ‚Äî like when you've been given a deluge of homework over vacation: a dozen term
               papers, two dozen books to read, and a mile-high stack of math problems.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun deluge is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it
               means an overwhelming amount of water. It comes from diluvian, which means flood. The verb deluge similarly means to overwhelm or inundate with
               something, particularly water. The hurricane deluged the island with rain. A deluge isn't always a bad thing, however. One thing most people
               would like to be deluged with? Money.[0m
