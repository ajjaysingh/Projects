[91m        SHORT  A denture is a section of false teeth, made to replace missing teeth in a person's mouth. Some kinds of dentures need to be soaked in a cleansing solution
               overnight.[0m
[36m         LONG  The denture part of a dental appliance is officially the plate to which false teeth are attached, but people tend to refer more generally to dentures, meaning
               the whole device. If an accident or dental disease causes you to lose adult teeth, you can have a dentist make dentures that are fitted exactly
               to your mouth. Some of these are permanent, while others are removable. Denture comes from the Latin root dens, "tooth."[0m
