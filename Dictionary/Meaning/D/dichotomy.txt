  SHORT        A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a clear distinction between two things.
  LONG         A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas — like war and peace, or love and hate — you have a
               dichotomy. You often hear about a "false dichotomy," which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an "either/or" scenario. For
               example, the statement "All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting" creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars
               that don't fit into either category.

     >         And in a way, that dichotomy itself points out the problem with defining—let alone actually getting rid of—”fake news.”
     >         It is this dichotomy that creates a beautiful Chardonnay.
     >         I felt my cramped religious framework of false dichotomies and moral starkness beginning to collapse.
     >         The last statement is tautological, and the dichotomy between “change” and “reaction” is a false one.
     >         In places like El Paso, these sorts of dichotomies are constant.
