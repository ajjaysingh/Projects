[91m        SHORT  To disconcert is to unsettle someone, make them feel confused and out of sorts. It's a mixture of to embarrass and to creep out.[0m
[36m         LONG  Disconcert comes from the old French word disconcerter meaning confused, which is just how it feels. The prefix dis means "not" ‚Äî it has a bad attitude and
               shows up in dismiss (not accept), dissonence (not harmonious), and disown (not own), among others. After dis comes concert from the word
               concerter "to bring together" (like at a concert!). If you disconcert someone, it‚Äôs like you dis them at a concert, and that person is not
               having fun. At all.[0m
