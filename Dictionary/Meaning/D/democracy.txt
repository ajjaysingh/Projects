[91m        SHORT  Whether you're talking about your glee club or a powerful nation, the word democracy describes government based on participation of the people, either
               directly or through elected representatives.[0m
[36m         LONG  Democracy traces back to the Greek words demos, meaning "people," and kratia, meaning "power." "People power" remains central to democracy, whether you're
               describing a country or a much smaller organization. If your glee club is run as a democracy, then everybody gets to vote on questions like
               what you're going to sing and what kind of outfits you‚Äôre going to wear. Because democracy assumes some idea of equality, it's often used to
               mean a just society, one in which everyone is treated equally.[0m
