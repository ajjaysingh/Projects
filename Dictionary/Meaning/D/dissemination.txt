[91m        SHORT  Dissemination is the scattering of information. If you've done something really embarrassing and don't want the whole school to know, let's hope no one who
               saw you is an expert in the rapid dissemination of humiliating facts.[0m
[36m         LONG  Dissemination builds on the word, seminate, meaning "to plan seeds." When you add the prefix dis-, you add the idea of separation, so to disseminate means to
               spread seeds widely. These could be literal seeds, like the dissemination of Oak genes by the scattering of acorns, or metaphorical seeds of
               ideas, like the dissemination of radical ideas through blogs, zines, and list-servs.[0m
