[91m        SHORT  To disillusion is to make someone realize their belief isn't true. If your cousin believes that the Tooth Fairy will come in the night, take her tooth and
               sprinkle her with fairy dust. It would be too cruel to disillusion her.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you disillusion someone, you take away a false belief, or an illusion. Your parents' divorce might disillusion your romantic ideas of marriage, and a
               political candidate you supported enthusiastically could disillusion if she doesn't follow through on her promises. The disappointment you feel
               as a result of being disillusioned is also called disillusion, like the disillusion that results when your older sister tells you the truth
               about the Easter Bunny.[0m
