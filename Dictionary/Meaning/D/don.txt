[36m         LONG  What is the opposite of don, an old-fashioned word meaning "to put on?" Doff another old-fashioned word meaning "to take off." These two words have something
               else in common - both are contractions from the 14th century English expressions do on and do off respectively. Don your boots before going out
               in the snow and doff them when you come inside again! A don is also a Spanish nobleman and a dean of a college at Oxford or Cambridge, but
               these meanings come from the Latin dominus meaning "master."[0m
