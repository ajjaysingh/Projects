[91m        SHORT  The verb deplore is used to express strong disapproval of something. If you really, really hate the way your mom makes meatloaf, then it's safe to say you

[36m         LONG  Deplore comes from Latin roots that mean to bewail or lament. So if you deplore something, you object to it because it brings you sorrow or grief. People
