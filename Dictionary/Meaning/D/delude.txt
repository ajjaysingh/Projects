[91m        SHORT  To delude is to trick or fool, often in relation to yourself. If you delude yourself into thinking your mom's chocolate cake is low in fat, you'll be

[36m         LONG  If you delude someone into thinking something, you are making a fool of them, or making them foolish. The word shares a root with ludicrous which means
               completely ridiculous. The thing that you foolishly believe is a delusion. Someone with delusions of grandeur has deluded themselves into
               thinking they are very, very special.[0m
