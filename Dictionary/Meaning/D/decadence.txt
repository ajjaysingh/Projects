[91m        SHORT  Whether in reference to chocolate cake for breakfast or wild all-night parties, decadence means extravagance, luxury, and self-indulgence with a sense of
               moral decline.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin root of decadence means "to fall down," and this may help you understand the full sense of the word. Decadence is not simply a synonym for excess;
               it also suggests that one's morals have gone down. The word is usually negative but not always. When hostile critics called a group of French
               writers and artists in the late 1800s decadents, these poets and painters embraced the label. When a pastry chef calls her creation Chocolate
               Decadence, she is promoting a mildly guilty pleasure, not announcing the end of Western civilization.[0m
