[91m        SHORT  A dupe is a furry, ceremonial hat occasionally worn during ancient pagan rituals... or not. Dupe actually means ‚Äútrick or deceive.‚Äù We‚Äôre sorry we tried to
               dupe you into believing the wrong definition.[0m
[36m         LONG  Dupe can also refer to the victim of a trick or hoax, and ‚Äî used in this sense ‚Äî it sometimes conveys the idea that the victim is easily fooled. Dupe comes
               from the French word for a type of bird called the hoopoe, which has an extravagant crest and a reputation for being dim-witted. (And no,
               that's not another attempt to dupe you; it's the truth!)[0m
