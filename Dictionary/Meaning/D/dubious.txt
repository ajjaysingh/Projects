[36m         LONG  Dubious stems from Latin dubiosus "doubtful" or "uncertain" and contains the Latin root duo in this case meaning "of two minds." This is apparent in that
               dubious generally describes something that appears one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true, whereas a dubious
               website or character is of questionable quality. Dubious can also be synonymous with doubtful when referring to a person as in "she was dubious
               about the idea."[0m
