[91m        SHORT  If your friend vacations in lavish hotels, wears thousand-dollar shoes, and refuses to eat cheese that costs less than $20 an ounce, you might say her
               lifestyle is decadent.[0m
[36m         LONG  A decadent is a person who has fallen into a state of moral or artistic decay. Typically, though, we use decadent as an adjective to describe wasteful
               indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-
               dollar parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read about them and their decadent
               lifestyles in the tabloid papers.[0m
