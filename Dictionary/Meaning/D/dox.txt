[91m        SHORT  You're most likely to hear a doxology in a Christian church, since it's a short religious verse or prayer that is sung.[0m
[36m         LONG  The brief chant or song that comes at the end of a prayer in a Catholic church is one kind of doxology. In the Lord's Prayer, which is common in many
               different Christian churches, the final line ending in "forever and ever, amen," was added on to the original ancient Biblical manuscripts and
               is considered a doxology. The word comes from the Greek doxologia, "praise or glory," a combination of doxa, "glory," and logos, "a speaking."[0m
