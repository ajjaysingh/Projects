[91m        SHORT  When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood trip to Disneyland, it's taken a digression ‚Äî it's strayed from the main topic.[0m
[36m         LONG  "But I digress" is a phrase often used by people when they realize they're no longer "on-topic." A digression is like a tangent, only digression often
               describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of digression is its
               relationship to the word progression. A progression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a digression, logically enough,
               is an idea that goes off in another direction.[0m
