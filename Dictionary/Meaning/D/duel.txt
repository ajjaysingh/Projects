[91m        SHORT  A duel is a fight between two people, usually using swords or other weapons. If you tend to be a little cowardly, you're probably glad that people aren't
               expected to defend their honor with a duel these days.[0m
[36m         LONG  The classic definition of a duel is the kind that happens all the time in Shakespeare plays: two men clanking swords together in a battle to the death over
               some issue of honor or betrayal. Today, the word duel can be used to talk about any kind of contest or struggle ‚Äî like a duel between political
               candidates. The word duel can be traced back to both duo, Latin for "two," and also duellum, which means "war."[0m

      Origin:  late 15th century: from Latin duellum, archaic and literary form of bellum ‚Äòwar‚Äô, used in medieval Latin with the meaning ‚Äòcombat between two persons‚Äô, partly
               influenced by dualis ‚Äòof two‚Äô. The original sense was ‚Äòsingle combat used to decide a judicial dispute‚Äô; the sense ‚Äòcontest to decide a point
               of honour‚Äô dates from the early 17th century.
