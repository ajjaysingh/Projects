[91m        SHORT  The drape of fabric or material is the way it looks â€” the shape it takes â€” when it's hanging. If you're sewing a dress, you need to use fabric with the right
               sort of drape.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can describe the drape of a piece of velvet or cotton â€” and you can also use drape to mean "curtain." You could even say, "I just love the drape of those
               drapes!" When drape is a verb, it means "to cover loosely," as when you drape a quilt over your old sofa to hide its the rips and stains. In
               the 1940s and 50s, drape was also a slang term for a cool suit of clothes.[0m
