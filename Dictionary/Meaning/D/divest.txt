[36m         LONG  Divest is sort of a fancy way to say ‚Äúdispose of.‚Äù It‚Äôs often used in a business context to describe companies or governments that divest some of their
               holdings by selling them off. It can also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes insane
               and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away from him.[0m
