[91m        SHORT  You can use the verb desist as a way to say "stop" or "cease." Instead of yelling "Cut it out!" the new neighbor asked the tween girls to desist from playing
               any more loud, screeching music from that long-haired boy-band.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you want to insist that someone stop doing something, the word desist is a solid choice. It's often used as part of a legal order called a "cease and
               desist," which forces an action to come to a halt. "Cease" is a synonym for desist, so using the two together says "stop it!" loud and clear ‚Äî
               and kind of redundantly. "If she will desist from camping on the lawn in front of the star's Hollywood home, she won‚Äôt be arrested."[0m
