[91m        SHORT  A denizen is an inhabitant or frequenter of a particular place: a citizen of a country, a resident in a neighborhood, a maven of a museum, a regular at a bar,
               or, even, a plant that is naturalized in a region.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun denizen comes from words that mean ‚Äúfrom‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin‚Äù and is related to ‚Äúcitizen.‚Äù  Denizen can be used when talking about any person or group of
               people that have a specific relationship with a place. It was historically used to refer to foreigners who were either naturalized or becoming
               citizens but now it is used much more generally, as in: "The denizens of my aunt‚Äôs neighborhood all have contracts with the same gardener."[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English deynseyn, via Anglo-Norman French from Old French deinz ‚Äòwithin‚Äô (from Latin de ‚Äòfrom‚Äô + intus ‚Äòwithin‚Äô) + -ein (from Latin -aneus
               ‚Äò-aneous‚Äô). The change in the form of the word was due to association with citizen.
