[36m         LONG  Percolation comes from the Latin word percolare, which means "to strain through." Percolation happens when liquid is strained through a filter, like when
               someone makes coffee. Drinking coffee can make you feel perky! Perky comes from the word percolate, too, describing something that bubbles
               over. Percolation (a noun) is what happens when anything percolates. Itâ€™s usually coffee, but chemists use percolation for all kinds of
               experiments.[0m
