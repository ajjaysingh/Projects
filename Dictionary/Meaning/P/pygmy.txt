[36m         LONG  The term pygmy, while still used by many who study and write about world cultures and groups, it is somewhat old fashioned and can be offensive to members of
               these cultures. Anthropologists often refer to groups in which men are on average shorter than four feet eleven inches tall as pygmies, though
               for the most part these people prefer to be known by their ethnicity. Pygmy comes from the Greek word pugmaios, or "dwarf."[0m
