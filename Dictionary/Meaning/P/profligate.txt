[91m        SHORT  Profligate, as a noun or as an adjective, implies recklessly wasting your money on extravagant luxury. Profligate behavior is a lot of fun, but you'll regret
               it later ‚Äî when you get your charge card bill.[0m
[36m         LONG  Any time someone behaves in a reckless, amoral, or wasteful way, they are engaging in profligate behavior. It usually refers to financial behavior but can
               cross over to social activity as well. A person who is a slave to their cravings and whose behavior is unrestrained and selfish can be called a
               profligate. Extravagantly profligate behavior is often wildly fun but usually comes with a heavy price to pay in the morning, both financially
               and morally.[0m
