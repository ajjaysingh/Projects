[91m        SHORT  If you present something for acceptance or rejection, you proffer it. Say your mom is under so much stress she forgets her own birthday.  You may want to
               proffer her some advice, like, "Quit that job."[0m
[36m         LONG  What's the difference between proffer and offer? If you say you "proffered" something to a friend, it suggests a spirit of generosity and it signals that your
               friend was welcome to accept or reject it as he saw fit. In other words, proffer is usually a little more polite than offer.  To remember this,
               think of the following equation: p[oliteness] + offer = proffer.[0m
