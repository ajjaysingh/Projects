[91m        SHORT  If you are patronizing, you tend to speak down to others, acting as though you are smarter, classier, or just plain better than anyone else. For the record,

[36m         LONG  A "patron" is someone who subsidizes or finances another person or organization ‚Äî usually an artist or charitable institution. So the word patronizing stems
               from this idea of someone bestowing money or help on another.  Today, the sense of condescension is strongly attached to the adjective, while
               the word "patron" is still a positive description of someone who gives.[0m
