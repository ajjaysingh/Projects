[91m        SHORT  A precis is a summary of something's main points. If you've ever jotted down notes about your main ideas before writing a persuasive essay, you've used a

[36m         LONG  Precis looks like precise, and of course, you always want your precis to be precise. But the words are pronounced differently. Precis comes from the French
               word prÃ©cis, so say it like this: "PRAY see." Or you can accent the other syllable: "pray SEE." The s is only pronounced if the word is plural:
               "PRAY sees." The spelling stays the same.[0m
