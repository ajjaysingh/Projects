[91m        SHORT  Psychosomatic describes a physical illness that results at least in part from mental causes. If you are under a lot of stress, the strain can trigger a
               psychosomatic condition like a stomach ulcer.[0m
[36m         LONG  Have you heard of the mind-body connection? That if you enjoy mental well-being you will also likely have good physical health — and vice versa? Psychosomatic
               originally used to describe the relationship between the body and the mind, and it comes from the merging of two Greek words, psykhe, mind, and
               somatikos, "body." A psychosomatic illness is triggered or made worse by a mental issue; the body gets worn down by things like constant worry
               and stress.[0m
