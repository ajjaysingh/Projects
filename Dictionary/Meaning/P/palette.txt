[91m        SHORT  A palette is a range of colors. It is also the board that artists use to hold and mix paint. Picture Picasso in his blue period: He is holding a palette on

[36m         LONG  The meaning of the word palette has extended beyond actual colors to include figurative colors. A musician can use a palette of tones and modes. Either way it
               is a limited selection from all things available. Don't confuse this word with the homophone palate which refers to your sense of taste. Both
               words come to English through Old French but have different Latin roots.[0m
