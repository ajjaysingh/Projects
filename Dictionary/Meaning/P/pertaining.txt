                                                                                    PERTAINING                                                                                    
  SHORT        To pertain is to be relevant or somehow associated with something.  If you're a lawyer, you try to find evidence that will pertain to the case and eliminate
               anything that is not connected.
  LONG         Behind the verb pertain lies the Latin verb pertinēre, which means "to be applicable" or "to hold through."  If you think the rules of the road don't pertain
               to you, try explaining that to the state trooper when you get pulled over.  Usage note: The word pertain often takes an s at the end, as in
               "That pertains to this matter," but loses it with a helper: “That doesn’t pertain to it.”
