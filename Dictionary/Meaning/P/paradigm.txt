[36m         LONG  The word paradigm comes up a lot in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in business could mean a new way of reaching customers and
               making money. In education, relying on lectures is a paradigm: if you suddenly shifted to all group work, that would be a new paradigm. When
               you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something.[0m
