[36m         LONG  The phil in philanderer means "love" and a philanderer's love never seems to stop. "So many ladies, so little time..." ‚Äî That may just be the motto of the
               quintessential philanderer, those delightful serial womanizers who specialize in brief affairs of the carnal kind. A philandering husband
               doesn't just have a wandering eye. He also has wandering hands, and probably a long line of jilted lovers.[0m
