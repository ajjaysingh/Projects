[91m        SHORT  Describe an action as prudent if it is the wise thing to do under the existing circumstances. If you're getting in trouble, it is probably prudent to keep

[36m         LONG  If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or
               action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin pr≈çvidƒìns from the verb "to foresee." The English word
               provident "wise in planning for the future" is the non-contracted descendent of the same Latin root.[0m
