[91m        SHORT  Something you can physically cross is passable. A passable trail through the woods isn't blocked by obstacles like fallen trees or flooded streams.[0m
[36m         LONG  After a hurricane, the roads you normally travel may not be passable because of dangling power lines or tree branches. This definition dates from the
               fifteenth century, literally meaning "able to be passed" or "able to be crossed." A later meaning of passable is "acceptable." You can use this
               word to describe things that aren't wonderful, but are good enough: "It's not the moistest cake I've ever tasted, but it's passable."[0m
