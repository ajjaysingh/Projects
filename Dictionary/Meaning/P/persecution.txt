  SHORT        Persecution is unfair or abusive treatment toward a person or group of people, such as the persecution of someone who is different by calling him or her rude
               names and making threats.
  LONG         The noun persecution is related to persecute, which comes from Latin persecut-, meaning “followed with hostility.” Persecution means hassling or singling out
               a person or group because of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or social status. In many schools, the persecution of
               students by bullies has resulted in a zero-tolerance policy for such despicable behavior.
