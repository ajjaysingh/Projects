[36m         LONG  Two synonyms for pinnacle also start with the letter "p," "peak" and "point." A pinnacle can be a physical thing, like the top of a high mountain or the
               antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a high point that can‚Äôt be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal. Whatever
               the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone the highest you can go. "Acme" is a great synonym
