[36m         LONG  When the word preposterous was first used, it meant reversing the normal order of things ‚Äî putting what was last first, and vice versa. Imagine putting on
               your underwear over your pants and you'll see that there's a kind of absurdity in something that's backwards, which is why preposterous came to
               mean "ridiculous." The word is often used as part of an exclamation: a chef who is asked to cook with nothing but jelly beans might exclaim,
               "That's preposterous!"[0m
