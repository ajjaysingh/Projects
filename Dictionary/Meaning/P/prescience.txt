[36m         LONG  The word prescience might look like pre + science, but it really comes from the Latin word praescientia, which means "fore-knowledge" ‚Äî or knowledge you know
               before anyone else. Don't assume it's a crystal ball kind of power that lets someone with prescience see the future. It's more like a state of
               mind or level of expertise that allows for excellent foresight and planning.[0m
