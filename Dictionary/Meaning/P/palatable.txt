[91m        SHORT  Something that is palatable is acceptable to one‚Äôs sense of taste‚Äîliterally or figuratively. If it's palatable, then you can put up with it ‚Äî whether it's
               leftovers or a mediocre made-for-TV movie.[0m
[36m         LONG  The palate is the roof of the mouth, the combination of structures that separates the mouth from the nose. Early anatomists believed that the sense of taste
               was located in the palate, and, just as taste is metaphorically expanded to include sensibilities beyond the experience of food and drink, so
               palatable can be used to describe phenomena beyond the culinary. And, while palatable can mean pleasing or agreeable, it generally means merely
               tolerable‚Äîedible, rather than delicious.[0m
