[91m        SHORT  Something that is dangerous or very risky can be described with the adjective perilous. If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick yourself for making
               such a perilous journey.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective perilous comes from the Latin word periculum, meaning dangerous. Words from the same root include peril, a noun meaning a dangerous situation,
               and imperil, a verb meaning to put in danger. The last thing you want to do as a parent is to imperil your children. Unfortunately, childhood
               is filled with peril ‚Äî from climbing on the monkey bars to eating paste, dirt, or bugs. If you think you can prevent all perilous situations,
               you haven't been a parent very long![0m
