[91m        SHORT  Predatory animals are those who kill and then eat ‚Äî in other words, "prey on" ‚Äî other animals. Hawks, lions, alligators, and human beings are all predatory
               animals.[0m

               advantage of senior citizens, the uneducated, or people who simply don‚Äôt understand the specifics of the loan or insurance policy they're
               signing up for. This is why it‚Äôs important to read the fine print of business documents.[0m
