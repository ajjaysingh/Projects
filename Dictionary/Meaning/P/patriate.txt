[91m        SHORT  A patriot is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. “Nathan Hale was a true patriot; his only regret was that he had but one
               life to give for his country.”[0m
[36m         LONG  The word patriot comes from patrios (Greek, not Latin for once), which means "of one’s father." So, despite various references to the motherland, the word
               patriot more or less lands us square in the fatherland arena. And if you’re a football fan, the New England Patriots is a near-Boston-based
               team (Boston being a major source of American patriots in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want to get yourself in trouble, you can wander
               Boston with a megaphone chanting, “The Patriots stink.”[0m
