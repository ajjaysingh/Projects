[91m        SHORT  Pedagogue is another name for "teacher," but one who is strict, stiff or old-fashioned, as in a pedagogue who stands in the front of the room and lectures for
               the entire class period, boring the students to tears.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun pedagogue, pronounced "PED-uh-gog," is the Old French word for "teacher of children." The emphasis here is on "old." To call a teacher a pedagogue is
               a deliberate choice because it implies that he or she is "the teacher that time forgot," possibly using notes and handouts from twenty years
               ago, standing in that same spot, year after year, saying the same things, as students stare out the same windows.[0m
