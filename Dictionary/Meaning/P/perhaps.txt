[36m         LONG  When someone asks if you want to do something and you say "Perhaps" ‚Äî you haven't committed. It's another way of saying "I don't know" or "It's possible. Who
               knows?" People use perhaps when talking about things they aren't sure about, or things they don't want to answer in a decisive way. When a
               friend says, "Perhaps we'll go to that movie," don't count on it. He's keeping his options open.[0m
