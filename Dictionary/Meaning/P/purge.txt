[91m        SHORT  To purge is to get rid of something or someone, and often it‚Äôs done suddenly. Purge rhymes with urge, and when you have a really strong urge to throw stuff
               away or clean something out, you have an urge to purge.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the Latin purgare, meaning "purify," purge is used as a verb for removing impure things, whether they're guilty feelings in a person or rotten vegetables
               in a refrigerator. As a noun, the act of tossing out the too-small clothes in your closet before getting new ones might be called a purge. It
               can be a very bad act, too, as when individuals have an unhealthy urge to purge or empty their stomachs after eating or when a military group
               decides to purge a certain ethnic group from a country.[0m
