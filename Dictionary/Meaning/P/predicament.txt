[91m        SHORT  If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult,
               confusing, and unpleasant situation.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means "a state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all
               about states of being‚Äì‚Äìpredict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the
               verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant state of being.[0m
