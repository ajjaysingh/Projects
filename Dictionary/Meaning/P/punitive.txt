[91m        SHORT  Punitive describes inflicting a punishment. If someone takes punitive action against you, you'll probably whine and complain — you're in trouble and you're
               about to get punished.[0m
[36m         LONG  An easy way to remember the meaning of punitive is that it looks like the word punish — both come from the Latin root word punire, "to inflict a penalty on."
               Punitive doesn't always refer to a person-to-person punishment, like a mom disciplining a child. It can also describe the unpleasant result of
               an action on a large scale, like the punitive effect higher taxes will have on the middle class.[0m
