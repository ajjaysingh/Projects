                                              PARLIAMENT                                              
  SHORT        In some countries — Great Britain for example — the group of people who make the
               laws is called the parliament. It's the equivalent of Congress in
               the United States.
  LONG         The most common meaning of parliament refers to a country's legislative (law-
               making) body. England's parliament is very famous. The word comes
               in part from the French verb parler, which means to speak, which
               makes sense since this group of people assemble to talk about laws
               and issues. Another meaning of parliament is the card game known as
               fan tan or sevens, where you lead with your sevens in a certain
               sequence and win by using up all your cards.
