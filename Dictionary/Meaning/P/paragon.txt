[91m        SHORT  Paragon applies to someone who is a model of perfection in some quality or trait. We link paragon with other words that follow it, such as "paragon of virtue"
               or "paragon of patience."[0m
[36m         LONG  A paragon means someone or something that is the very best. The English noun paragon comes from the Italian word paragone, which is a touchstone, a black
               stone that is used to tell the quality of gold. You rub the gold on the touchstone and you can find out how good the gold is. You are hoping
               that it is the paragon of "goldness."[0m
