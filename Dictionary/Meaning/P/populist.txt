[36m         LONG  In politics, the word populist refers to someone who puts ordinary people's rights above those of the wealthy and powerful. It is basically a synonym of
               democrat, which when spelled with a lower-case d is simply a person who believes in democratic principles of rule by the people, freedom, and
               equality. The root of populist is the Latin word for "people," populus.[0m
