[91m        SHORT  A purist is a person who insists on following certain rules exactly ‚Äî to the letter. If you're a language purist, it upsets you to hear someone using bad

[36m         LONG  Most purists are fans of tradition and traditional rules, always sticking to those rules themselves and often instructing other people to do the same. To be a
               purist is to be a kind of perfectionist ‚Äî a baking purist might feel that cookies made without a certain brand of chocolate chips are vastly
               inferior, for example. The noun purist originally referred specifically to language use, and it comes from the Latin purus, "clean, clear, or
               unmixed."[0m
