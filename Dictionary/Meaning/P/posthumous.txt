[91m        SHORT  If something happens after someone dies, it is described as posthumous ‚Äî like the posthumous interest in the music of a singer who died "a nobody."[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective posthumous comes from Latin ‚Äî post means "after" and humare, "to bury." (You might also think of humus, which means "dirt" or "earth.") So
               something that is posthumous happens after a person is dead, like the posthumous discovery that your humble neighbor who lived very modestly
               was actually a multi-millionaire, or the posthumous publication of a book that the writer finished just before she died.[0m
