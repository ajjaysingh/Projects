[91m        SHORT  Parallax is how an object's position seems to shift, the way a person appears to move when you alternate looking through a camera viewfinder and using just
               your eyes.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can get an idea of what parallax is by closing first one eye and then the other; the object you're focused on seems to move slightly. Parallax also
               describes the way that objects appear different depending on where an observer is located. It's a concept that helps astronomers measure the
               distances between planets, stars, and moons. The root word is Greek, parallaxis, meaning "a change."[0m
