[36m         LONG  If you've studied Spanish, you know that the verb pensar means "to think." If you're pensive, you might simply be thinking hard about something. Having no
               expression or maybe even frowning can be a result of being so engrossed in your thoughts ‚Äî it might not reflect a melancholy attitude. Remember
               this the next time you're about to ask a pensive person, "What's wrong?" It could very well be nothing.[0m
