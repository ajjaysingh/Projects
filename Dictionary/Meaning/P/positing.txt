[91m        SHORT  To posit something is to assume or suggest that it is true. You can posit an idea or opinion.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you posit, you submit an idea or give an opinion. Scientists posit many ideas — called hypotheses — that they then try to prove or disprove through
               experimentation and research. In science, you hear about positing a lot, and the same is true in math and logic. When you say "If X, then Y"
               you're positing a proposition. Positing can also mean to put something somewhere firmly — this means to deposit, fix, or situate.[0m
