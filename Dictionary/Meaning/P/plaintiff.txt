[91m        SHORT  In a courtroom, the plaintiff is the person or group who is accusing another person or group of some wrongdoing. If you’re the plaintiff, you are claiming
               that a law was broken, and you’re in court to present your case.[0m
[36m         LONG  The plaintiff accuses, the defendant tries to prove that accusation wrong.  You’ve seen this relationship on television shows about lawyers, or maybe you’ve
               been to court yourself.  The Old French root word translates as “complain” and the Latin root is literally “beating of the breast,” or
               explaining your grief in a dramatic way.  Plaintiff shares roots with the adjective plaintive, which describes a sorrowful sound.  The
               plaintiff made a plaintive cry when the defendant was declared not guilty.[0m
