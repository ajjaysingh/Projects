[91m        SHORT  The word paucity means not enough of something. If you've got a paucity of good cheer, for example, you'd better cheer up![0m
[36m         LONG  One good way to remember the meaning of paucity is that it's a bit like pauper, as in The Prince and the Pauper. The prince had too much money, and the pauper
               had a paucity. There are a lot of words that mean "little" or "small," but paucity is used when you mean specifically "not enough" or "too
               little." People in LA don't understand how New Yorkers can live with such a paucity of space. For what New Yorkers pay for a tiny apartment,
               Angelenos get a house and a yard.[0m
