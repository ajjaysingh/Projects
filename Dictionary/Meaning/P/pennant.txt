[91m        SHORT  A pennant is a long flag that tapers at one end. You might see a pennant flying on a navy ship, being waved in the crowd of spectators at a baseball game, or
               hanging on a sporty kid‚Äôs bedroom wall.[0m
[36m         LONG  Nautical pennants were the original triangular or tapered flags, and they are still flown on most active warships. Sporting pennants also have a long history,
               and were once commonly given as prizes or trophies and waved by fans in the stands at high school and college sporting events. Sports teams can
               still win a pennant, but pennants are often purchased as souvenirs at games and wind up on fans‚Äô walls.[0m
