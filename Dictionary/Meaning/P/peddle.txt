  SHORT        When you peddle something, you go out and try to sell it. It's cute when a little kid peddles his homemade birthday cards around the neighborhood, but if an
               adult did that it might be annoying.
  LONG         The classic image of someone who peddles is an old-fashioned "peddler" or "tinker" traveling from village to village selling goods. The verb peddle, in fact,
               comes from the word "peddler," whose origin is a mystery. Any time you sell something by going from place to place, like selling Girl Scout
               cookies to all your neighbors, you peddle.
