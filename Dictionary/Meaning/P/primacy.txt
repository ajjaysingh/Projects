[91m        SHORT  Something with primacy has first importance. If you are deciding who to take on an all-expenses-paid trip up the Amazon, the quality of being chill and fun

[36m         LONG  Primacy comes from primary, meaning first, and it is like a condition of always having first place. If you are the teacher‚Äôs pet, you might have primacy over
               your classmates. You can also talk about primacy within a field. Madonna, Beyonce, and Shakira have all at one time or another achieved primacy
               in the field of pop music. Keep practicing, maybe you'll be next.[0m
