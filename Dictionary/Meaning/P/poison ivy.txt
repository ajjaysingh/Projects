[91m        SHORT  Poison ivy is a vine-like plant with clusters of three leaves, and it oozes oil that gives most people an itchy rash with blisters. Poison Ivy is also the
               name of a comic book villain. Stay away from both.[0m
[36m         LONG  Despite its name, poison ivy isn't a type of ivy, though it is a climbing plant that spreads quickly across the ground and climbs up trees and fences. Many
               animals can safely eat the leaves and berries of poison ivy, but the majority of people are severely allergic to it. If you hope to avoid
               poison ivy, remember the saying "Leaves of three, let it be," a reference to the plant's distinctive groups of three leaflets.[0m
