[91m        SHORT  A plebiscite is a direct vote by eligible voters to decide an important public question, such as a change to the constitution, secession, or a similar issue
               of national or regional importance.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word plebiscite comes from the Latin word plebiscitum, meaning a decree of the people, with the roots plebs, "the common people," and scitum, "decree." A
               plebiscite can also be called a referendum. Periodically, for example, Quebec separatists hold a plebiscite to determine whether Quebec should
               secede from Canada. So far, the secessionists have not prevailed at the polls.[0m
