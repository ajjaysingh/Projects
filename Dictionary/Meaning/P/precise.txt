[91m        SHORT  Precise means strictly correct or very exact. If you need something to be precise, like the positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon,

[36m         LONG  The word precise might make you think of nerdy scientists with rulers or stiff accountants double checking their calculations. But being precise, or
               painstakingly accurate, has its merits. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, it‚Äôs important that the arrangement of ingredients
               be precise: Place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight.[0m
