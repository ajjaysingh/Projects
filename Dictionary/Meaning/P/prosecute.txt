[91m        SHORT  To prosecute is to participate in or pursue something to completion, like a government‚Äôs intention to prosecute a war. Prosecute is most often used for
               bringing legal action against an accused person or group.[0m
[36m         LONG  Prosecute comes from the Latin, ‚Äúprosesutus,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúfollow after.‚Äù The legal sense of the word first appeared in the 1570s. A district attorney will often
               prosecute, by bringing legal charges and action against a person or group (watch any TV legal drama, and the prosecution will no doubt
               prosecute eventually). A company may prosecute by suing to protect against damages. Prosecute should not be confused with the word persecute,
               which means to harass or oppress.[0m
