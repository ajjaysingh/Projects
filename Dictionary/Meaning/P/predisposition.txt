[36m         LONG  Predisposition comes from the Latin prae meaning "before," and disponere meaning "put in order, arrange, distribute." If you have a predisposition to think or
               act a certain way, you can anticipate your reaction before it happens.  A genetic predisposition means you are likely to inherit a trait from
               your parents. Someone might have a genetic predisposition to diabetes or to another illness.[0m
