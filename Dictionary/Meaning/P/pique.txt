[91m        SHORT  The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just means to arouse,
               stimulate, or excite.[0m
[36m         LONG  Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pƒìk" and were borrowed from a French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from piquer "to prick." So
               you can see how something that pricks you could make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating‚Äì‚Äìenough to make you want to storm away
               from learning vocab. That storming away, by the by, might be called a "fit of pique."[0m
