[91m        SHORT  Perchance means “by chance” and is an old-fashioned or literary way to say “maybe.”[0m
[36m         LONG  Perchance comes from the Old French phrase par cheance, which means — you guessed it — "by chance." Perchance thinking of a French poet such as Baudelaire
               will help you remember the definition. People use this word when they’re unsure of something, and they want to sound fancy. If you say,
               “Perchance it will rain,” you’re not sure about the chance of rain, and you might be wearing a chapeau. Use the word perchance if you like to
               kick it old school.[0m
