[91m        SHORT  A perpetrator is someone who has committed a crime — or at least done something pretty bad. You've probably seen cops on TV trying to get a description of the
               perpetrator of a bank heist.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word perpetrator is so often associated with crime that police officers and other criminal justice types sometimes abbreviate it “perp.” A perpetrator is
               often a suspect until it has been proven that he or she carried out the offense. The word usually describes someone who's committed a crime,
               but any wrongdoing will do. If someone took Uncle Bob's cake and a trail of crumbs leads to your bedroom, your mom will know who the likely
               perpetrator is.[0m

[3m             > More often than not, victims are told the perpetrator will kill them if they tell or kill their parents.[0m
[3m             > “That anyway, these children are not physically touched and the perpetrators are actually overseas.”[0m
[3m             > That’s being done even as Facebook and others are deflecting allegations that technology companies are complicit in terrorist attacks because the perpetrators
               use their platforms.[0m
[3m             > The leaked documents appeared largely mundane, and the perpetrators remain unknown.[0m
[3m             > Both were in the same jail as the perpetrator.[0m
