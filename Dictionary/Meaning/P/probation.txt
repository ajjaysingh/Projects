[91m        SHORT  A probation is a period of time when a criminal needs to be on their best behavior: they're not in jail (yet or anymore) but they have to do certain things
               demanded by the court.[0m
[36m         LONG  Being put on criminal probation is like getting a second chance before more serious penalties apply: you might have to pay a fine, do community service, or be
               monitored to make sure you don‚Äôt get into any more trouble. Some criminals are released from jail early and put on probation. People also talk
               about probation for non-criminal issues: there could be a probation period for joining a club, when they check you out before deciding to let
               you in.[0m
