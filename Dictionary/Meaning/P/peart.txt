[91m        SHORT  A part is a section or portion of something larger. When you injure a body part, you only hurt one arm or foot, rather than your entire body.[0m
[36m         LONG  Part can be used to mean a section of a whole, like a bicycle part, or Part Six of your book. To an actor, a part is a role in a movie or play, and to a hair
               stylist, it's the line on your scalp where your hair is combed in opposite directions. As a verb, it means "to divide or separate," and the
               Latin root is partem, "a part or portion."[0m
