[91m        SHORT  The noun poignancy refers to something that is deeply touching, especially something that brings forth strong emotions like sympathy, sadness, or sorrow. The
               poignancy of the movie may bring you to tears. Bring tissues. Lots of tissues.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun poignancy is from the Old French word poindre, which means "to prick or sting." Related words include the adjective poignant. Similar words include
               pathos and bathos, although both of these words often imply a sort artificiality that poignancy does not. Pathos can imply a trick by the
               writer or speaker to produce sympathy or sadness and bathos can imply artificial sentimentality, so poignancy is often the preferred word when
               genuine emotion is involved.[0m
