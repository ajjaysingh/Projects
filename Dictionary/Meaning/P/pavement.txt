[91m        SHORT  Pavement is a hard surface that's covered in concrete or asphalt, like a road or a driveway. If you wipe out on your bike and land on the pavement, you may
               end up with skinned knees or scraped elbows.[0m
[36m         LONG  When pavement is newly surfaced or patched, it's smooth and even — but after a long, cold winter pavement is often full of potholes and cracks. In the US,
               pavement most often refers to a road or street, but it can also mean any paved surface, like a sidewalk or paved area in a park. The word has a
               Latin root, pavimentum, "level surface that's been beaten firm."[0m
