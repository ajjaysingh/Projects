[91m        SHORT  These days, asking the pharmacist for a physic to relieve your constipation will probably get you a blank stare; it's an old-fashioned, rarely-used term for
               "laxative."[0m
[36m         LONG  Physic comes from the Latin word for "study of nature," so it's unclear how it came to mean a "purging medicine." An almost-synonym is "cathartic," although
               that word is usually used to describe an emotional purging- like a good cry- rather than physical one. Don't confuse physic with physics, the
               scientific study of the interaction between energy and matter, or psychic, someone who can read minds and see the future.[0m
