[36m         LONG  The Puritans were a group of English Protestants that formed in the 16th century to bring about religious reform. The Puritans wanted to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the church
               by following intensely strict religious principles, which earned them the name Puritan. Puritan can still refer to the religious group ‚Äî in
               that case it‚Äôll have a capital ‚ÄúP‚Äù ‚Äî but nowadays you‚Äôre more likely to hear it used to describe someone who follows a strict moral code and
               shuns almost all pleasures.[0m
