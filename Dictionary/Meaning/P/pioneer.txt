[36m         LONG  Pioneer comes from the old French for foot soldier or laborer, and particularly for groups of soldiers that would go out ahead of the rest of the troops to
               prepare the way. The European settlers who came to America in the 16th century are known as pioneers, as are the later groups who traveled West
               in the 18th and 19th centuries. We also use pioneer for anyone who takes initiative in a field, such as science or education.[0m
