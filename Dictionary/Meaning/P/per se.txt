[91m        SHORT  Per se is the phrase to use when you want to refer to a particular thing on its own. It is not this Latin phrase, per se, that is important, but rather the
               concept it represents.[0m
[36m         LONG  Per se is handy when you need to single out a particular element of a bigger thing. So you might say, "The song, per se, wasn't a bad choice; it was your
               singing voice that was atrocious." In Latin it means "by itself." When you want to sound a little smart, inject a per se into what you're
               saying. It's one of those phrases, like "insomuch" or "as it were," that helps win arguments.[0m
