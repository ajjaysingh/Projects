[36m         LONG  Describing someone as puritanical is usually a bit of a criticism, since the word implies that the person is not just religious, but overly rigid in his or
               her beliefs and not a lot of fun to be around. It stems from the word "Puritan," a believer in the branch of Protestantism that objected to
               some practices of the Church of England. Its root, in turn, is thought to be purity, which is what puritanical people seek when they stick to
               the rules.[0m
