[36m         LONG  The word proselytize can specifically refer to religious evangelism, as in: "Proselytizing is a fundamental component of Mormonism." Proselytize, however, can
               also be used for any situation when people are trying to convince others to try something or to join something. TV ads proselytize about the
               pleasures of life with mouthwash, friends proselytize about how great their favorite video games are, and moms proselytize about the benefits
               of eating vegetables.[0m
