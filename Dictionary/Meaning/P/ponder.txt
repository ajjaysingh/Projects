[91m        SHORT  "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary" is the first line of Edgar Allen Poe's poem The Raven. Many a deep thinker has repeated it
               while musing. But if you've given up deep thinking, you may say instead, "Nevermore."[0m
[36m         LONG  Think of ponder as reflecting on weighty thoughts. It will help you remember the definition if you can remember the word's Latin roots. It comes from
               ponderare, which literally meant to weigh, and pondus, which means weight. People sometimes use the word ironically, for example, when someone
               asks you to do something you really don't want to do. You may tap your chin for a second and say, "Let me ponder that." Pause. "Um, no!"[0m
