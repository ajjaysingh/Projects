  SHORT        To procreate is to reproduce. In other words, to procreate is a more formal way of saying "making babies."
  LONG         Notice the word create in procreate? That's a clue that this word is about making something, in this case, making more creatures. People procreate by having
               sex and then children. Birds procreate when they lay eggs. Plants procreate asexually — without sex. Sometimes it's difficult to convince
               pandas to procreate in zoos. All forms of procreating result in more critters like the originals. Your parents procreated, or you wouldn't be
               here.

     >         Those that are stopped from procreating are disproportionately black and brown, poor and immigrant.
     >         Few people know that before 1676, people from Europe and Africa lived, worked and procreated together in the Mid-Atlantic states as equals.
     >         Urging people to procreate is one of the most stupid and damaging things any leader can do.
     >         Sex—more specifically, the urge to procreate and nurture a family—has proved to be one reliable trip wire.
     >         That’s hardly sufficient if even a fraction of Chinese couples decides to procreate past a single child.
