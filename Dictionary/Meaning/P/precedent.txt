[91m        SHORT  A precedent is something that sets a standard for future events. It's hard to say what the legal community would do without the word precedent, since so many
               legal judgments and decisions are based on what came before.[0m
[36m         LONG  Lawyers and judges often look for a precedent can be used as a guide for a similar case. This word is used elsewhere too. Your mom might not let you stay up
               late because it would set a bad precedent for future bedtimes. A teacher who lets kids chew gum is setting a precedent that gum-chewing will be
               OK in the future. People often refer to a precedent later on as a reference point for how things should be.[0m
