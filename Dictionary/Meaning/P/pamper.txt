[91m        SHORT  When you pamper your dog, you spoil him. You might pamper him by feeding him cubes of cheese and knitting him a little sweater and letting him sleep in your
               bed under the covers.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some people love to pamper their pets, cooking them special food and buying them expensive collars and toys. To pamper goes beyond kind treatment, bordering
               on overindulgence or coddling. People also like to pamper themselves from time to time, getting a massage or a manicure, or otherwise being
               treated indulgently. The word pamper originally meant "to cram with food," most likely from a Middle Dutch root meaning "to cram."[0m
