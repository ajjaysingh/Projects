[91m        SHORT  This sassy little adjective pert is lively and bold, like your pert best friend who storms in and demands to borrow your favorite jacket.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although pert is found inside its synonym impertinent (rudely bold), pert can also mean stylish, like that pert fedora cocked at a jaunty angle. Someone
               healthy and bright-eyed is pert, too. You might be pert after a strong cup of coffee and a pep talk, or after a visit from the celebrity
               stylist. Although pert has been around since the 1300s ‚Äî from Middle English, ‚Äúunconcealed, bold‚Äù ‚Äî it is also the name of a shampoo that
               embraces all shades of meaning of this four-letter word.[0m
