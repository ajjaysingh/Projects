[91m        SHORT  There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pedantic means "like a pedant," someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book
               learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to
               bore you with his in-depth knowledge of Chinese porcelain kitty-litter boxes.[0m
