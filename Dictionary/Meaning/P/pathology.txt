[91m        SHORT  Pathology is the medical term for the way a disease works. A tumor is removed by a doctor trained in surgery, but you need a doctor trained in pathology to
               tell you if the tumor is cancer.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pathology derives from the Greek pathos "suffering" and ology "study of"â€“â€“to give us "the study of disease," but often pathology means the disease's
               behaviorâ€“â€“the cancer pathology is to take over healthy cells and grow cancerous tumors.  We also use pathology to describe abnormal conditions
               that arenâ€™t really diseases, like the pathology of Hollywood stars who live their lives in public and become obsessed with fitness.[0m
