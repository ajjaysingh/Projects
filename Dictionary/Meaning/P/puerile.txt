[91m        SHORT  Some people like their movies to have sophisticated humor and others prefer the more puerile humor of pratfalls or jokes about smelly underwear, inappropriate
               belching, and passing gas.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although the adjective, puerile can be used to describe anything related to childhood, more often than not, it is used in a derisive manner to comment on the
               immaturity, silliness, or juvenile nature of something or someone. So if you hear someone talk about puerile toys, they may merely be remarking
               on the toys of childhood, but it is more likely they are discussing whoopee cushions, fake dog poo, and the like.[0m
