[36m         LONG  Use the noun prognostication when someone's making a forecast or a guess about upcoming events. Your prognostication about whether or not it will rain
               tomorrow might lead to your family's picnic being cancelled. Another way to use the word is to mean a sign or portent: "I hope that black cat
               isn't a prognostication of bad luck!" The Latin root, prognostica, means "sign to forecast weather," and it comes from the Greek prognostikos,
               "foreknowing."[0m
