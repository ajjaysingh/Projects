  SHORT        Being stuck in standstill traffic can feel like purgatory, but this brief spell of unpleasantness is nothing compared to the misery endured by souls waiting
               to get into heaven, which is the original meaning of the word.
  LONG         Purgatory comes from a Late Latin verb meaning "to cleanse" â€” purge shares the same root. In Roman Catholic doctrine, souls atoned for past sins in purgatory
               before entering heaven. In fact, for centuries, purgatory was often regarded as an actual physical place. Today, if you say you are in
               purgatory, you feel stuck or not able to continue towards a goal. High school might feel like purgatory because even though you're finished
               with your carefree childhood, you don't have the freedoms of adulthood yet.

     >         Those were a means by which a Catholic sinner might buy his way out of seemingly interminable purgatory after death, speeding directly into heavenly bliss.
     >         Later it feels like purgatory, a wintry place with flat skies, leaden waters and unwelcome reminders of the past.
     >         Within 100, the climb had turned into a gasping, gut-wrenching purgatory, each swing of the ax and kick of the toe-spikes a herculean effort.
