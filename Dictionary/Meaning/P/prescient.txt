[91m        SHORT  To be prescient is to have foresight or foreknowledge. We can use this word to describe people themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment.[0m
[36m         LONG  You probably know that the Latin prefix pre- means "before," so you might be able to figure out that the word prescient, from the verb praescire, means to
               "know beforehand." People like economists, sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of
               their job to sift through the data and make predictions ‚Äî and sometimes they get it right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say
               they're prescient.[0m
