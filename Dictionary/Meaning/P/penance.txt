[91m        SHORT  Penance is the act of doing a good deed to make up for past wrongs. Shoveling your neighbor's sidewalk all winter could be your penance for not helping rake
               the leaves that dropped from your tree into his yard during the fall.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although the noun penance can mean any remorse for past mistakes, or any voluntary action meant to right the wrong, Penance, with a capital P, also
               specifically refers to a sacrament in the Catholic Church. When a person receives Penance, he or she confesses sins to a priest, and along with
               a blessing, receives an order to do something, such as say certain prayers. This assignment is also called penance.[0m
