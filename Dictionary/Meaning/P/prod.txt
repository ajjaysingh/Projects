[91m        SHORT  A teacher might use a verbal prod when students aren't participating in class. A prod is an encouragement, like the threat of a quiz. Just hope the teacher
               doesn't use the kind of prod a rancher uses to keep cattle moving![0m
[36m         LONG  Prod can also be a verb that refers to a soft poke or a nudge, like when you prod someone in the ribs with your finger. It can also describe verbal
               encouragement that's used when you want something or want to know something. For example, you might prod your sister into helping you do your
               math homework.[0m

               18th century.
