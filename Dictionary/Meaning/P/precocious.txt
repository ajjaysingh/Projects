[91m        SHORT  That high school hoops phenom who plays like an NBA pro? The sixth grader who's already asking questions about organic chemistry? They're both precocious ‚Äî

[36m         LONG  When you look at the Latin roots of precocious, it all makes sense. When pre (meaning "before") joins coquere (meaning "to ripen"), you have something that is
               ripening prematurely. And in the case of precocious, you are usually describing young people who have some adult-like quality about them. Maybe
               it's their vast vocabulary, maybe it's their ease with Calculus, or maybe it's just applying lipstick.[0m
