[91m        SHORT  To prate means to talk on and on about something. While it may be interesting to hear about other people’s vacations, when they prate about them until the wee

               she encouraged a cigarette and a good, stiff glass of whiskey for Civil War soldiers. Herman Melville warned against mocking a lover’s wounded
               heart, saying “the stabbed man knows the steel; prate not to him that it is only a tickling feather.”[0m
