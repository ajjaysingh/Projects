[91m        SHORT  A punctilious person pays attention to details. Are you always precisely on time? Is your room perfectly neat? Do you never forget a birthday or a library
               book's due date? Then you are one of the punctilious people.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective punctilious, pronounced "punk-TIL-ee-us," is related to the Italian word puntiglio, meaning "fine point." For someone who is punctilious no
               point is too fine, no detail too small, to be overlooked. The word is often used to describe people, but it can be used more broadly to apply
               to observations, behavior, or anything else that is characterized by close attention to detail.[0m
