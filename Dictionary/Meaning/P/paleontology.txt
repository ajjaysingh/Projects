[36m         LONG  Scientific language aims at clarity, and scientists generally speak to each other in Greek and Latin. The commonly used suffix -ology comes from Greek, and it
               means "the study of." The prefix paleo means "old." So, paleontology is the study of that which is old—really, really old. The word
               paleontology entered the English language in the nineteenth century, just as scientists were making a systematic effort to analyze fossil
               records.[0m
