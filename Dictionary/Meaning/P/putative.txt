  SHORT        You might be the putative leader of your lacrosse team, even if someone else holds the title of captain.  Putative means to be known as something by

  LONG         Every once in a while, a putative planet is reported in the news, which we get very excited about and which usually turns out to be an illusion. But in 2005,
