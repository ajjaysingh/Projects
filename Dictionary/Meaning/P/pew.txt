[36m         LONG  Some courtrooms have pews, but mostly they're found in churches, as seating for the congregation and sometimes for the members of a choir. After the
               Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century, pews first began to appear in churches. Before that they were rare, as sitting and listening
               to a sermon was uncommon. Many of these earliest pews were paid for by (and considered the property of) individual families. Pew shares a Latin
               root with podium.[0m
