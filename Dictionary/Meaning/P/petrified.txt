  SHORT        If you scare someone so much they can't move, you petrify them. Petrify is to make something like a stone or to literally turn to stone.
  LONG         At the heart of the word petrify is the Latin word petra which means "stone." In the scientific sense, wood petrifies in an environment without oxygen, say
               when it is buried by lava, and minerals such as silica enter the wood and fill the cells, making it hard as stone. More commonly, something
               petrifies a person or an animal when it scares them very much. During thunderstorms, the dog is so petrified that it hides under the bed. If
               you are in a store when it is being robbed, you might be petrified too.

     >         I was petrified, because all I could think about was my son.”
     >         When he arrived, he found the man and three friends high on drugs, and remembers being "petrified".
     >         In your hands the closed, half-inch thick body could be a petrified notepad, as lithe and paradoxically unyielding as a MacBook Air.
     >         Sipe stopped counting how many hours he spent working late at night painting cicadas and carving Styrofoam into petrified wood.
     >         Inside, more history, less mystery: Petrified wood in the great-room and outdoor fireplaces followed the family from Federal Way.
