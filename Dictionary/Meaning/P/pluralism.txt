[91m        SHORT  If you believe in pluralism, you believe that people of all races, classes, religions, and backgrounds should be able to get along on equal footing in
               society.[0m
[36m         LONG  Can you hear the word plural, meaning "more than one," in pluralism? Someone who believes in pluralism believes that there are many different ways to live,
               and thinks that government and society should be structured in such a way as to encourage and appreciate people's differences. The extreme
               opposite of pluralism is totalitarianism, when one supreme dictator makes all the decisions and no one can contradict him. In the Catholic
               Church, pluralism is also the practice of holding more than one office at once.[0m
