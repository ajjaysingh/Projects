[36m         LONG  In politics, the term populism can have different meanings depending on who is using it and what their political goals are. At its root, populism is a belief
               in the power of regular people, and in their right to have control over their government rather than a small group of political insiders or a
               wealthy elite. The word populism comes from the Latin word for "people," populus.[0m
