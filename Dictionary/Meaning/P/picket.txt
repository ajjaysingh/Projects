[36m         LONG  Besides the "wooden stake or strip" meaning, you can also use picket as a verb to mean "protest or strike." When disgruntled workers go on strike, they often
               picket outside their workplace, holding signs and chanting. You can also call one of these protesting workers a picket. The original meaning,
               from the 1680s, is "a pointed stake used as a defensive weapon." And the original picket line was a line of military troops.[0m
