[91m        SHORT  Primordial, an adjective, describes something that has been around forever, like cockroaches.[0m
[36m         LONG  Primordial comes from the Latin words primus, meaning "first" and ordiri, "to begin." So it is easy to see that this adjective means "first of all, original."

               it opened.[0m
