[91m        SHORT  A prerogative is someone's special right or privilege. As Bobby Brown once sang, "I don't need permission / Make my own decisions / That's my prerogative."[0m
[36m         LONG  Prerogative goes back to a Latin root for a group having the right to vote first (prae- 'pre-' + rogare 'to ask') and thus came to mean "privileged rank." In
               current use, it refers to a right or privilege held by any person or group. A near synonym is privilege, which puts more emphasis on the fact
               that others do not have it. The self-justifying phrase "That's my prerogative" (for example, in reference to changing one's mind) is quite
               common.[0m
