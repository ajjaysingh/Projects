[91m        SHORT  A prescription is an order written by a doctor for someone to get a drug that is not available without this permission. If you get a bad ear infection, you'll

[36m         LONG  When your doctor writes a prescription, she's advising you to take a medication that you can only get from a pharmacist. You can refer to the paper with the
               drug's name and the doctor's signature and the bottle of medicine as a prescription. Sometimes prescription is used in a non-medical way to
               simply mean a suggestion or recommendation, like laughter and friends ‚Äî a great prescription for chasing away the blues.[0m
