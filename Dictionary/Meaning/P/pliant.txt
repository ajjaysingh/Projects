[91m        SHORT  The adjective pliant describes something that is capable of being bent. "The teenager showed off her pliant spine every time she draped herself over a piece
               of furniture. Why hanging upside down off the sofa didn't give her a headache, her mother would never know."[0m
[36m         LONG  Pliant has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Pliant can describe something that is bendable â€” like a spine, a tree branch, a bendy straw â€” or it can
               describe something that is flexible, but less tangible. In this latter sense, pliant describes something that adjusts to conditions or is
               easily influenced: "In order to survive the recession, the company had to be pliant and adjust to the new economic conditions."[0m
