[91m        SHORT  Probate is the act of proving the legal validity of a will. A will may require probate because the person that signed it isn‚Äôt around to verify his or her

[36m         LONG  As Ambrose Bierce wrote, ‚ÄúDeath is not the end. There remains the litigation over the estate.‚Äù So comes the need for the probate. Though probate, from the
               Latin probare, ‚Äúto test or prove,‚Äù is usually used for wills, it can also be applied to other legal documents, as in the proving of the
               validity of a document, or an official certification proving the document is real. Probate is also a verb meaning ‚Äúto place a convicted person
               on probation.‚Äù[0m
