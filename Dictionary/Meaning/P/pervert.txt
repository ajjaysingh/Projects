  SHORT        To pervert something is to corrupt it. For example, you could "pervert the course of justice" by lying on the witness stand.
  LONG         Another common use of pervert is as a word for a person who is sexually deviant; however, people also use this word more loosely to describe anyone who seems
               creepy. Perverting also means changing or subverting something. A cop who breaks the law is perverting the law. A criminal who convinces other
               people to become criminals is perverting them. So when you think of pervert, think change — change for the worse.
