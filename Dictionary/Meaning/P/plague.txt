[91m        SHORT  When the homeowner described her ant problem as a plague, the exterminator thought she was being a bit melodramatic. After all, a few bugs aren't exactly a
               huge calamity.[0m
[36m         LONG  Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the plague, that friend would have hightailed it in the other direction. In the Middle Ages, the
               plague was a  horribly contagious illness that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of people. Thanks to the introduction of
               better hygiene and antibiotics, plague doesn't describe a killer disease as often these days. Instead, it commonly overstates an annoyance,
               like an apartment dweller claiming his building is plagued by cockroaches.[0m
