[91m        SHORT  If you pine for someone, you desperately want to see them, be with them, or perhaps smother them with kisses. If you're texting your ex-boyfriend over 50
               times a day, there's a pretty good chance that you still pine for him.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Old English, pine meant "to torture or cause to experience pain," which seems quite fitting if you've known what it's like to pine for something or
               someone. The verb pine should not be confused with the noun pine, as in the evergreen tree. If you are from the Northeast and find yourself
               living in the Caribbean, you may pine for the sight of a pine tree, but the lovely weather should ease the pain.[0m
