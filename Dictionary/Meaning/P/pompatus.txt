[91m        SHORT  A pompous person is arrogant or conceited. He'll walk into a party with an inflated ego, ready to tell anyone who will listen that "I'm kind of a big deal."[0m
[36m         LONG  Today we associate the adjective pompous with self-important jerks. But it's actually derived from the Old French pompeux, which meant ‚Äústately." And that's
               why you can also use pompous to describe something with a lot of ceremonial or stately display ‚Äî in other words, something surrounded by "pomp
               and circumstance."[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Pompatus  /Ààp…ímp·µªt…ôs/, /Ààp…ímp…ôt…ôs/ is a nonsense word coined by Steve Miller and most famously used in his 1973 hit single "The Joker". The oddness and
               unknown  meaning  of the word occasioned some attention and further use, including being used in the title of a movie.

The word "Pompatus" does exist in the Oxford English Dictionary, and it means "to act with pomp and splendor." Miller most likely heard the word on a song called "The Letter," which was recorded by the Los Angeles Doo-Wop group The Medallions in 1954.
