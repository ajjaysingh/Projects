[36m         LONG  When you profiteer, you don't just profit ‚Äî you profit more than you should at the expense of someone else. You can also call a person who does this a
               profiteer. Profiteers famously take advantage of things like scarce food or ongoing conflicts to make a lot of money. The word existed but
