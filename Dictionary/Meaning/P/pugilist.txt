[91m        SHORT  Pugilist is a fancy word for boxer, one who indulges in the noble art of pugilism, or fighting with one's fists.[0m
[36m         LONG  Be warned when people use the term pugilist or you see it in the paper. Nowadays such a term is often sarcastic in tone and critical of boxing's claims for
               legitimacy, often suggesting it's essentially savagery masquerading as  sport. If you hear "the term "fighter" you can be more certain it's
               used with approval, or at least without prejudice.[0m
