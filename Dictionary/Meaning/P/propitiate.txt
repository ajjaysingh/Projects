[36m         LONG  One of the most common uses of propitiate historically was in the sense of appeasing the Gods, often  with a gift in the form of an animal or human sacrifice.
               Fortunately, for most people today flowers and candy will do the trick. But then again, some Moms can be tough to appease.[0m
