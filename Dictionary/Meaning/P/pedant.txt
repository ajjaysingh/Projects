[91m        SHORT  A pedant is an annoying person who is focused on minor details and book knowledge rather than ordinary common sense. In war, it can be dangerous to have a
               pedant as commander‚Äì‚Äìhe'll insist on textbook maneuvers instead of adapting to circumstances on the ground.[0m
[36m         LONG  This word was borrowed from French p√©dant or Italian pedante "teacher, schoolmaster," but its ultimate origin is unknown. One theory is that the original
               meaning of Italian pedante was "foot soldier," associated with the Italian word pedagogo "teacher" because teachers are always on their feet.
               Another theory is that Italian pedante was formed from the root of Greek paideuein "to teach," which happens to be the source of English
               pedagogue "teacher." In fact, a pedagogue is a pedantic teacher.[0m
