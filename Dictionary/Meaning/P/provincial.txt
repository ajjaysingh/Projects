[91m        SHORT  A provincial person comes from the backwaters. Someone from a small province outside of Provence, France, might seem a little more provincial and less worldly
               than someone from, say, Paris.[0m
[36m         LONG  Something or someone provincial belongs to a province, or region outside of the city. Provincial has a straightforward meaning when describing where someone
               is from, but it has some other shades of meaning too. Something provincial can be quaint and in a pleasing rural or country style, but it also
               can imply someone less sophisticated, as in someone with provincial, or simple, tastes. Individuals or groups of people who are considered
               narrow-minded are often labeled provincial, even if they're from the city.[0m
