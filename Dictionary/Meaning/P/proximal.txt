[91m        SHORT  Something that is proximal is situated closest to the point of attachment or origin. In medicine, it means closest to the center of the body.[0m
[36m         LONG  The opposite of proximal is distal and these terms are also used in geology. If you're talking about the proximal lava beds, you mean the ones closest to
               where the volcano erupted. Proximal is related to proximity, which means "nearness," and approximate, which means close to the original.[0m
