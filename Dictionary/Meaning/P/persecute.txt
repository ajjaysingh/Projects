[91m        SHORT  To persecute is to make someone suffer or to keep them in bad circumstances. In some parts of the world governments or military groups persecute, or punish,

[36m         LONG  You can use the verb persecute to talk about abusive acts against a person or group of people. Persecute is usually used to specify the harm done to a
               particular group, as when a person is persecuted for his affiliation with a religious group. Those born of a certain race or culture can be
               targets too. Adolf Hitler became notorious for his orders to persecute the Jewish people.[0m
