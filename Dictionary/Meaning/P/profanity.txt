[91m        SHORT  Profanity is a type of language that includes dirty words and ideas. Swear words, obscene gestures, and naughty jokes are all considered profanity.[0m
[36m         LONG  You know those four-letter words you're not supposed to say? They're profanity: language that's vulgar and obscene. R-rated movies and cable stations like HBO
               have a lot of profanity, but you won't hear it on a station like NBC or ABC. Profanity tends to be about off-color subjects, like sex and going
               to the bathroom. Everyone probably spews some profanity at some point, but you better be careful about who's listening.[0m
