[91m        SHORT  To peck is to jab or bite at something the way a bird does with its beak. A peck is also a unit of measurement, like when Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
               peppers. (‚ÄúEight quarts‚Äù just didn‚Äôt sound right.)[0m
[36m         LONG  Most birds peck at their food, and when a person eats in a bird-like way, they also peck. Another way to peck is to give someone a light kiss, a peck on the
               cheek. A completely different kind of peck is a unit of measurement. In the US, a peck is one quarter of a bushel, or two gallons of a dry
               substance. The verb sense of peck comes from 1500s thieves' slang, in which it meant "food."[0m
