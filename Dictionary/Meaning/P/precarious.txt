  LONG         The Latin root of precarious means "obtained by asking or praying." This fits well as precarious always signals that help is needed desperately. If your life
               is precarious or you are in a precarious situation, things could become difficult, maybe even dangerous, for you. If your footing or hold on
               something is precarious, it is unstable or not firmly placed, so that you are likely to slip or lose your grip.
