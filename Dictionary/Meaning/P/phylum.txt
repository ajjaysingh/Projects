[91m        SHORT  If someone asks you what you have in common with the Antarctic icefish, you can say that you both belong to the same phylum, meaning the same taxonomic group:
               you are both vertebrates.[0m
[36m         LONG  Biology types are probably already familiar with using the word phylum as a way to classify animals and plants. Mammals, including humans, are part of the
               phylum chordata, which also includes fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. As you can see that‚Äôs a very broad category. Phylum comes above
               class and below kingdom in the biological classification system. The ranks get increasingly narrow, working all the way down to species, which
               is a closely related group.[0m
