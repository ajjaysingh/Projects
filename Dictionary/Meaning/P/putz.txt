[36m         LONG  You can use the informal putz when you need a good put-down for someone who's acted idiotically. Your cousin who starts a guinea pig circus, or your neighbor
               who constantly parks his car on your lawn might both be called putzes, although you might want to speak quietly if either one is familiar with
               Yiddish. In that language, a putz is not only a fool, but also a specific part of the male anatomy (and not the elbow).[0m
