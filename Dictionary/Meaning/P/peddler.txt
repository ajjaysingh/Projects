  SHORT        A peddler is a specific type of salesperson: someone who travels from town to town selling their wares.
  LONG         A peddler is someone who sells things, but it's a very specific type of selling. Peddlers — also known as hawkers and pitchmen — travel from town to town,
               especially with a carnival or circus. Peddlers are also found on the street, selling many different things, from jewelry to DVDs. There's a
               shady implication to this word, since peddlers have included people selling snake oil and other worthless products. Instead of buying from a
               peddler, you're probably better off at a store.

     >         We are past all that, say the peddlers of the “color-blind” Constitution.
     >         “We must be very careful not to fall prey to the siren call of those who are peddlers of false hope, illusions and lies.”
     >         In 1977, the Smidts copied the model of another former peddler who was importing tools from Japan and undercutting American retailers.
     >         During a debate party last night, Ballard’s Peddler Brewing Company decided to get a little creative with its tap list.
