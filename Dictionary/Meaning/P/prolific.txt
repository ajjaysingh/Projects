[36m         LONG  It is interesting to note that many of the words used to describe the adjective prolific are relayed in biological terms, such as "to give birth," "nourish,"
               and "fertile." Other uses of the word pertain to having many ideas or an active and expressive mind, such as a "prolific writer." Clearly,
               people like to consider that the ideas or things that they make are in some way produced by them like flowers or fruit![0m
