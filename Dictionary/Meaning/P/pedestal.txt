                                                                                     PEDESTAL                                                                                     
  SHORT        A pedestal is  a base or foundation that supports something like a statue or work of art. Think of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. where a statue of
               Lincoln sitting in a chair is raised up on a huge pedestal.
  LONG         Think of the physical stand or support when you use pedestal figuratively to mean a place of superiority. If you put someone on a pedestal, you honor that
               person or place him or her above you, as you might a piece of valued art. If you want to knock someone off his or her pedestal, you think that
               person is too arrogant and you want to do something to humble him or her.
