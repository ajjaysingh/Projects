[91m        SHORT  Working class, blue collar, plebeian and certainly not aristocratic ‚Äî that's what the adjective proletarian means.[0m
[36m         LONG  Proletarian has roots in the Latin word proles, which means "offspring." That's because back in ancient Rome, a proletarian was a member of the proletariat,
               the class of society that had no wealth and didn't own property. The only thing these proletarians had to offer was their hard work and their
               children. Today's proletarians are a little better off; they're considered the working class and just might have better benefits through their
               unions than some white-collar workers out there.[0m
