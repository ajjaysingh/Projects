                                                                                     PRECLUDE                                                                                     
  SHORT        To preclude something is to prevent it from happening. A muzzle precludes a dog from biting.
  LONG         This is a very formal word, but it has a simple meaning: when something is precluded, it can't happen. See the prefix pre in preclude and in prevent? It is
               signaling that these words are all about things done before another action would happen — to make it impossible. Staying away from water
               precludes the possibility of drowning, though it also precludes any chance of having fun swimming.
                                                                            EXAMPLES FROM VOCABULARY:                                                                             
     >         The most extreme example is the big bang creation: Even an infinitesimal change to its explosive expansion value would preclude life.
     >         As the Supreme Court has long recognized, this guarantee precludes certain forms of entrapment.
     >         “What happens at the federal level would not preclude a district...from being able” to protect students from discrimination.
     >         But if Trump follows through on that threat, he could impose new sanctions, justify tariffs on imports and preclude China from some U.S. financing deals.
     >         The undergirding notion was that to live with physical limitations was to live a partial life: illness or disability precluded fulfilment or freedom or
               happiness.
