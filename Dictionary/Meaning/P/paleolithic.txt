[91m        SHORT  When you're talking about the era when humans hunted and gathered, lived in bands, and made tools out of wood and bone, you can call it paleolithic.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective paleolithic is usually capitalized, since it's the scientific term for a specific period of human history more than two million years ago.
               People sometimes call something paleolithic when it's really, really old. However, when anthropologists talk about the Paleolithic era, they
               mean the stage when humans truly became human, building homes, tools, jewelry, art, and began to observe rituals and early religious beliefs.[0m
