[91m        SHORT  Pliable means bendable but not breakable. Wax is pliable, good leather is pliable.  If you describe a person as pliable, it usually means that he's easily

[36m         LONG  When Madame barks "Plier!" (rhymes with "okay") in ballet class, all the students obediently bend their knees into a graceful semi-crouch. Plier is French for
               bend and it's the root of the word pliable. The word pliable itself is quite pliable, an apt description for everything from building materials
               to a person's character.[0m
