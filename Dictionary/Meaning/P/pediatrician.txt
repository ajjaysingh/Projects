[36m         LONG  The word pediatrician has only been in use since the turn of the 20th century. Some people also use the word pediatrist to mean the same thing — a doctor who
               specializes in treating children ranging from newborn babies to adolescents. Pediatricians study pediatrics, both of which stem from a form of
               the Greek pais "children." The remainder of the word comes from the Greek iatros "healer."[0m
