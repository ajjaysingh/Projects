[36m         LONG  Psychopath is a psychiatric term that refers to a person suffering from a mental illness involving violent behavior or various kinds of abnormal social
               interactions. A person who's been diagnosed as a psychopath has a lot of trouble interacting with other people and living a normal life. The
               noun psychopath is also used casually to mean simply a bizarre or unpredictably violent person. The word comes from the Greek words for "mind"
               and "suffering": psykhe and pathos.[0m
