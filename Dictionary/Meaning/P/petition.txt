                                                                                     PETITION                                                                                     
  SHORT        If you're angry about the new rule that you have to wear bright pink shoes to work every day, why not write up a petition, get all your co-workers to sign it,
               and submit it to your boss.
  LONG         Petition comes from the Anglo-Norman word peticiun, meaning "demand, request," and when you petition someone, you ask them to consider your request. If you
               write up a statement, say against the town's approval of a new carnival district, and collect signatures from 100 neighbors to turn in to the
               city government, that's a petition. If you pray to the carnival gods to reign down ruin on the carnival, that's also a petition — and no
               signatures needed.

     >         While many of his constituents have signed the pro-garden petition, he worries that the perpetual obligation could burden city workers and finances into, er,
               perpetuity.
     >         It added: “In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court.”
     >         A petition signed by hundreds of women demanded an apology and sanctions against the station.
     >         She would change it not just by signing petitions, or protesting, or calling her legislators.
     >         The deadline for the petition for the recount in Wisconsin was Friday, while Pennsylvania's deadline is Monday, and Michigan's is Wednesday.
