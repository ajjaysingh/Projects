[91m        SHORT  If you're angry about the new rule that you have to wear bright pink shoes to work every day, why not write up a petition, get all your co-workers to sign it,
               and submit it to your boss.[0m
[36m         LONG  Petition comes from the Anglo-Norman word peticiun, meaning "demand, request," and when you petition someone, you ask them to consider your request. If you
               write up a statement, say against the town's approval of a new carnival district, and collect signatures from 100 neighbors to turn in to the
               city government, that's a petition. If you pray to the carnival gods to reign down ruin on the carnival, that's also a petition — and no
               signatures needed.[0m
