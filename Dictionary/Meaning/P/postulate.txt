[36m         LONG  Anyone who has suffered through geometry class is familiar with some of the greatest hits, like Euclid's postulate and the point-line-plane postulate. Those
               are propositions that have to be assumed for other mathematical statements to follow logically. As a verb (pronounced "POST-you-late") it
               describes the act of presenting an idea, theory, belief, or concept.[0m
