[36m         LONG  The noun pacifism comes from the Latin word pacificus, "peaceful, or peace-making." People who are devoted to pacifism avoid any kind of violence in their own
               lives, which usually includes refusing to support wars or serve in the military. Famous practitioners of pacifism include Ghandi, Martin Luther
               King, Jr, and Jesus.[0m
