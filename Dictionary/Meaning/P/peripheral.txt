[91m        SHORT  Scanners, printers, and speakers are peripheral devices for a computer because they aren't central to the working of the computer itself. Anything peripheral
               is on the margin, or outside, while main things, like a computer's processor, are not peripheral.[0m
[36m         LONG  Outside of computer jargon, peripheral is a common term in eye exams, which measure peripheral vision to see how far toward the outer right and left edges you
               can see. Peripheral also describes nerves from the body's peripheral system, which are secondary to the main system but branch off of it â€” like
               the wires between peripheral devices and a computer.[0m
