[91m        SHORT  When you prevaricate, you lie or mislead. Now, go ahead and tell me whether you already knew that meaning, and don‚Äôt prevaricate about it ‚Äî give me the story
               straight![0m
[36m         LONG  While prevaricate basically means to lie, it also has the sense of making it hard to know exactly what the lie was. You talk in a confusing way, go back and
               forth, and as deliberately as possible mislead someone. Government officials, bureaucrats, and sneaky types prevaricate in the hopes that it
               will be too difficult to figure out whether they've been doing something wrong. Don't prevaricate with your parents ‚Äî it will definitely make
               you look guilty, but they just won't be sure of what![0m
