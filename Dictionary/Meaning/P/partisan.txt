[91m        SHORT  If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear of the partisan politics in the U.S.— since
               politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.[0m
[36m         LONG  Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the
               American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or
               — more rarely it seems to American voters — the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix bi is added to show the support from both
               parties.[0m
