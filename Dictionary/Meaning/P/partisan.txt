                                                                                     PARTISAN                                                                                     
  SHORT        If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear of the partisan politics in the U.S.— since
               politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.
  LONG         Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the
               American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or
               — more rarely it seems to American voters — the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix bi is added to show the support from both
               parties.

     >         “Except for his towering ambition, Schumer is a Democratic Jim Baker, fiercely partisan when necessary but usually the ultimate pragmatist.”
     >         But I will not be forced to legitimize their fears, fueled by partisan rhetoric, whipped up into a fury by social media.
     >         We know from research, however, that policy preferences can flow from partisan identity rather than the other way around.
     >         Throughout the election, we tracked conversations among thousands of partisans on Twitter to gauge which side seemed more interested and enthusiastic at any
               given moment.
     >         They support or obstruct administration initiatives along partisan lines, and when in support they receive fundraising and bureaucratic favors from the
               president in return.
