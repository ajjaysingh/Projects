[91m        SHORT  That which is palliative relieves and soothes, but isn‚Äôt expected to cure. A heating pack is a commonly employed palliative for temporarily reducing the pain

[36m         LONG  From the French palliatif, which in turn came from the Middle Latin palliates, palliative was first recorded as an adjective in the 1540‚Äôs, and then later as
               a noun in 1724. To palliate is to alleviate without curing, so it makes sense that a palliative is the agent for this type of relief. ‚ÄúLife as
               we find it, is too hard for us: it brings us too many pains, disappointments and impossible tasks,‚Äù said the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund
               Freud. ‚ÄúIn order to bear it, we cannot dispense with palliative measures‚Ä¶‚Äù[0m
