[91m        SHORT  If you have a teacher who asks the class to call him "Mr. B," it's probably because his name is really hard to pronounce. When you pronounce a word, you sound
               it out.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you say something in a particular way, you pronounce it. The verb pronounce has another meaning, too ‚Äî "to declare formally." It's not too different from
               announcing something, but it implies something more official and solemn ‚Äî just think of the phrase "I now pronounce you husband and wife."[0m
