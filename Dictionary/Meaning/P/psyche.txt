[91m        SHORT  Another word for the place where your thoughts come from is your psyche. Not your actual brain, but whatever it is that generates all of your thoughts and
               emotions.[0m
[36m         LONG  Psyche comes from the Greek psykhe, which means ‚Äúthe soul, mind, spirit, or invisible animating entity which occupies the physical body.‚Äù That about sums the
               way we understand the word today. People have their own individual psyches of course, but you often hear the word used to describe the similar
               mind set or thought process of a group of people, such as "the American psyche."[0m
