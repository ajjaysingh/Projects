[36m         LONG  Scientific language aims at clarity, and scientists generally speak to each other in Greek and Latin. The commonly used suffix -ology comes from Greek, and it
               means "the study of." The prefix paleo means "old." So, paleontology is the study of that which is oldâ€”really, really old. The word
               paleontology entered the English language in the nineteenth century, just as scientists were making a systematic effort to analyze fossil
               records.[0m
