[91m        SHORT  If your cattle are feeling hungry, you should let them pasture, or graze, in a grassy field known as a pasture. Pasture is both a noun and a verb associated
               with grazing animals.[0m
[36m         LONG  As a noun, a pasture is a field where animals such as horses and cattle can graze, or feed. Pasture can also refer to the grasses or other plants that grow in
               a pasture. As a verb, pasture means "to graze" or "to release animals into a pasture for grazing." You also might hear this word used in the
               idiom "Put out to pasture," which means "to retire someone," usually because of old age.[0m
