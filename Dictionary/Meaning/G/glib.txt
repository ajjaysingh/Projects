[91m        SHORT  A hiring manager might think you're being glib, or slick and insincere, if you say you've led a successful multinational corporation when you were actually in
               charge of flipping burgers for a fast-food restaurant chain.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word glib might be used to describe the slick car salesman who uses his polished sales pitch to talk his customers into buying lemons. In fact, the word
               comes from old German and Dutch words for "slippery," another word that could be used to describe the very same salesman. In addition to
               meaning "smooth" and "persuasive," glib can be applied to the kind of thoughtless comment that could get you into big trouble. Telling your
               boss that you had a "hot time" with his daughter is the kind of glib remark that could end your career.[0m
