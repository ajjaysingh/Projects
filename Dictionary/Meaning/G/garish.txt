[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective garish to describe something that is overly vivid, bright, showy, and in bad taste ‚Äî like the DJ's garish outfit that is a flashback to the
               disco era.[0m
[36m         LONG  Garish comes to English from the Old Norse word gaurr, meaning "rough fellow." It is often used to describe colors, clothing, decorations, and other things
               that can be elegant and tasteful. Because the word connotes bad taste, however, it is rarely used in a complimentary way. If you say to your
               friend, "I like your garish hair and makeup," she is not likely to take it well, unless, of course, you are going to a 70s flashback party.[0m
