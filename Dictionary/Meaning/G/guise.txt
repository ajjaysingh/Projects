[91m        SHORT  The noun guise refers to an outward appearance that conceals the true nature of someone or something. Your classmate might chat with you under the guise of
               friendship, but you know she's really just looking for juicy gossip.[0m
[36m         LONG  No doubt you‚Äôve noticed the similarity between guise and disguise. Both involve the art of deception: it‚Äôs the methods that differ. Guise is about trying on
               new attitudes and mannerisms, such as speaking and acting in the guise of a native in a place where you are actually a tourist. Disguise
               involves hiding your real identity, disappearing in the new role.[0m
