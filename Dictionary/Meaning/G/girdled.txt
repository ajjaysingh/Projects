[91m        SHORT  A girdle is a tight-fitting undergarment that supports the lower body. The purpose of a girdle is to make a person's waist and stomach look smaller and
               firmer.[0m
[36m         LONG  Girdles are thought of as old-fashioned ladies' underwear these days, though they are still worn by some ‚Äî and many others wear "foundation garments" that are
               essentially modern girdles. Before the late 1960s, many women wore girdles, until the availability around that time of control-top pantyhose.
               Another kind of girdle is simply a ring that encircles something ‚Äî a belt, a band of bark around a tree, or the Earth's equator.[0m
