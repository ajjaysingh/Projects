[91m        SHORT  During the Salem witch trials in the late 1600s, women accused of witchcraft were executed by hanging, a gruesome process that involves a gallows, or wooden
               frame from which a person is hung by a rope.[0m
[36m         LONG  A gallows is a frame, usually wood, that is made up of a horizontal crossbeam from which a noose or rope is suspended. The word gallows has an s at the end of
               it because a gallows usually consists of two upright poles and a crossbeam. As a form of capital punishment, hanging is outlawed in almost
               every state, making the use of gallows these days very rare. If you see one, it will be in a museum.[0m
