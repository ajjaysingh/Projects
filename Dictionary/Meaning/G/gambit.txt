[91m        SHORT  A gambit is a strategic move, often in chess but also in politics or business, where a player sacrifices something up front for future gain.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun gambit comes from an Italian word, gambetto, which means ‚Äútripping up.‚Äù When you make an opening move, offer something, or start a conversation with
               something that seems self-sacrificing but is really a ploy for greater advantage in the long run, that's a gambit. In chess, a gambit is when
               you sacrifice a pawn early for better positioning. When you offer to drive the morning carpool, that might be a gambit to get the afternoon
               shift off.[0m
