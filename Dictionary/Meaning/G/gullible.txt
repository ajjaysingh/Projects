[91m        SHORT  If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled.[0m
[36m         LONG  It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull, meaning "to swallow." This would be a funny coincidence as gullible describes an overly
               trusting person who tends to swallow the stories he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun "don't be such a gull!" or as a
               verb "you can't gull me into believing that!"[0m
