  SHORT        If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled.
  LONG         It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull, meaning "to swallow." This would be a funny coincidence as gullible describes an overly
               trusting person who tends to swallow the stories he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun "don't be such a gull!" or as a
               verb "you can't gull me into believing that!"

     >         The recount may be a progressive gambit to raise money from the gullible, or perhaps to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election.
     >         Children can be remarkably gullible but also absolutely impervious to reality.
     >         Trump told his apparently insanely gullible crowd in Tampa, Florida: “He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him.”
     >         Candidates who use exaggeration and fabrication on a regular basis would quickly alienate their gullible supporters.
     >         “In retrospect, I would maybe ask ourselves if we weren’t a little too gullible,” said Rolf Jacob, head of the prison where Mr. Albakr died.
