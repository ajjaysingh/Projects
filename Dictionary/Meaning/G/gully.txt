[91m        SHORT  A gully is a deep valley that's formed by water that runs across and land and wears it away. Most gullies form along hillsides.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a stream or runoff from a heavy rainfall erodes the land and forms a ravine or ditch, the result is a gully. The origin of the word is unclear, but it
               may come from the Middle English golet, "water channel." If you hear someone use the somewhat old fashioned term "gully washer," they're
               talking about a torrential rain storm ‚Äî one that's heavy enough to form a gully.[0m
