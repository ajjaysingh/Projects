[36m         LONG  In the 16th century, the gamut was the lowest note on the musical scale. In music as well as life, the word has expanded to mean from high to low, or the
               whole range. The word is often associated with "run," as in "run the gamut from totally excited to so terrified you're quaking with fear." And

      Origin:  late Middle English: from medieval Latin gamma ut, originally the name of the lowest note in the medieval scale (bass G an octave and a half below middle C),
               then applied to the whole range of notes used in medieval music. The Greek letter Œì (gamma) was used for bass G, with ut indicating that it was
               the first note in the lowest of the hexachords or six-note scales (see solmization).
