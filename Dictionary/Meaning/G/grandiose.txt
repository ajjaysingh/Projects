[91m        SHORT  You've got big plans. Huge plans. Whatever it is, it's going to blow minds and absolutely rock worlds! Well, to some people those plans might sound a bit
               grandiose, or unnecessarily overblown and even highfalutin.[0m
[36m         LONG  Coming from the Italian word grandioso (meaning "grand" or "noble"), the adjective grandiose is kind of like Italian hand gestures: big, exaggerated, and over
               the top. And it's that excessiveness that pushes something grand (large, with an air of distinction) into grandiose (large, but trying too
               hard) territory.[0m
