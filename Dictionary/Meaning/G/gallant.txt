[91m        SHORT  If you volunteered to deal with removing a huge, hairy spider from your bathroom ceiling, your whole family would be grateful for your gallant actions. The
               adjective gallant means "heroic or brave."[0m
[36m         LONG  In the past, gallant was used to describe a man's behavior toward a woman, especially if he saved her from something or helped her with something she was
               unable to do on her own. It can still be used that way, but more often it describes any kind of bravery, and it is just as correct to describe
               a woman's bravery as gallant as it is a man's.[0m
