[91m        SHORT  A newspaper or journal can be called a gazette. In fact, many English-language newspapers from coast-to-coast include the name gazette in their title, from
               The Daily Hampshire Gazette in Massachusetts to the Mariposa Gazette in California.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun gazette comes from the Italian word gazzetta. In the 1600s, there was a Venetian news sheet that became known as a gazeta because it cost a gazeta, a
               small-valued Venetian coin. Other experts suggest that the word comes from gazza, a kind of bird ‚Äî specifically a chattering magpie ‚Äî that
               would spread news. A related word is gazetteer, which is a dictionary of geographical names.[0m
