  SHORT        The verb galvanize refers to stimulating muscles with an electrical current, and this word is also used to suggest stimulating someone into action. We advise
               not using electricity in galvanizing children to do their homework.
  LONG         The word galvanize was coined to honor the 18th Century scientist Luigi Galvani, who found that a spark could make a frog's legs move. This discovery led to
               further studies in bioelectrogenesis, or what Galvani called "animal electricity," and became the basis for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (a
               novel in which a mad scientist attempts to use electricity to galvanize a monster to life). Nowadays, people use this term much more
               figuratively, like when they describe galvanizing a political movement or even a sports team into action.
