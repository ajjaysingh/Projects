[91m        SHORT  When something is very, very, VERY big, it can be called enormous. ‚ÄúGood heavens, that pimple on your cheek is absolutely enormous; it covers half your face!‚Äù[0m
[36m         LONG  The word enormous contains within it, if you look closely, the root norm, as in normal. So what you‚Äôre saying when you call something enormous is that it‚Äôs
               beyond what is normal; you‚Äôre trying to convey a sense of exaggerated difference. You may also have heard the word ginormous, which people try
               to use as enormous with a dramatic flair. But, trust us: ginormous is not a good word; it‚Äôs just a blend of two words ‚Äî gigantic and enormous.[0m
