[91m        SHORT  If I ask you to give me a general sense of how a car works, I'm looking for you to describe the two or three main principals in a few minutes, not to open the
               hood, take apart your engine, and tell me everything you know.[0m
[36m         LONG  General comes from the French word g√©n√©rale, which means "common to all people," but we use it for more than just people. You might inquire about the general
               habits of schoolchildren, or the general temperature at night in the desert. And when someone's a general in the army or another organization,
               like the Surgeon General of the United States, for example, that means they oversee everything. So "general" is a high ranking, because
               generals are in charge of so many.[0m
