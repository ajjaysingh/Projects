[91m        SHORT  To gratify is to give satisfaction. So if you've managed to get straight A's in school, what you did was gratify your parents ‚Äî and it probably felt pretty
               gratifying to you too.[0m
[36m         LONG  There's a strange taint to the word gratify. Sure, it means to do one's best to please, like the little straight-A student that you are, but there's also a
               hint of indulgence about the word. How often have you heard the phrase "gratify one's desires" used disapprovingly? Slightly hoggish, a bit
               self-indulgent, that's gratify for you.[0m
