[91m        SHORT  If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks ‚Äî it's from the Latin word grex, meaning "herd." Not surprisingly, people began using it
               to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in
               reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory ‚Äî but if you know an outgoing fellow
               with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.[0m
