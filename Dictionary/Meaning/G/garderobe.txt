[91m        SHORT  All of the clothes in your closet make up your wardrobe. If you're tired of your wardrobe,  it just might be time to go shopping.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the words warder, meaning ‚Äúto protect‚Äù, and robe, meaning a ‚Äúpiece of clothing,‚Äù wardrobe originally meant an entire room where a person's clothing was
               stored. Nowadays, most people don‚Äôt have an entire room for their clothes, so the word wardrobe has downsized to just a large cabinet, or the
               clothing itself. A wardrobe can also be the costumes (or the costume department) of a theater company or  movie.[0m
