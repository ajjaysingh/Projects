[36m         LONG  The noun gaiety is the feeling of happiness and delight that might be present at a child's birthday party or a festive square dance. Gaiety can describe a
               person's generally joyful personality, or the sound of laughter in your house. It comes from the French word gaiet√©, "joy, merriment,
               lightheartedness," which evolved from gai, "charming, joyful, happy." The word can be correctly spelled gaiety or gayety, although the first
               spelling is much more common.[0m
