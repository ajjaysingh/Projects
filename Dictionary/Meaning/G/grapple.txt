  SHORT        When you wrestle with something — literally or figuratively — you grapple with it, or try to overcome it.
  LONG         If you trace the word grapple back to its French roots, you’ll discover that the word originally referred to "a grape hook," a pronged tool used to harvest
               grapes. If you think about how awkward it would be to harvest grapes, with the individual grapes ready to scatter everywhere, it makes sense
               that grapple eventually evolved to include a verb form used to describe struggling with something unruly. You might grapple with a budget
               shortfall, grapple for answers, grapple with a wrestling opponent, or grapple with a new technology.
