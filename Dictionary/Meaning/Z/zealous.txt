[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective zealous as a way to describe eagerness or enthusiastic activity. If you are too zealous in your efforts to decorate the house with Christmas
               lights, you might cause a power outage for the whole neighborhood.[0m
[36m         LONG  Zealous is the adjective for the noun zeal "eager partisanship"; the latter has a long e, but zealous has a short one: ZEL-uhs. It can have a slightly
               negative connotation, and people are sometimes described as "overzealous," meaning they try too hard. "Zealous" rhymes with "jealous" (and in
               fact they're from the same Greek word), but don't confuse them: a jealous person might be resentful of someone who makes zealous efforts to
               achieve success.[0m
