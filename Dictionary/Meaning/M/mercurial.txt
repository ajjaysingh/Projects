[36m         LONG  Mercury was the ancient Roman god of commerce and messenger of the gods, and the planet Mercury was named after the Roman god. In Middle English, this
               adjective meant "relating to the planet or god Mercury" and derives from Latin mercuriƒÅlis, from Mercurius "Mercury."  A mercurial personality
               has the unpredictability associated with the god Mercury or, in astrology, is supposedly influenced by the planet.[0m
