[91m        SHORT  The tiny details of anything can be called minutiae. Minutia — which you'll usually see as minutiae, the plural version — is a little like trivia.[0m

               love minutiae — like what a player's batting average is, right down to the third decimal point. Anytime you're dealing with itty-bitty details,
               you're looking at minutiae.[0m
