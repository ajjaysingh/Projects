[91m        SHORT  A mugwump is someone, especially in politics, who sits on the fence. Mugwumps don't commit to one side or the other.[0m
[36m         LONG  This odd word refers to something common: someone who is neutral or uncommitted, especially in politics. A mugwump isn't committed to a party, candidate, or
               belief. Mugwumps could be in the middle of the road or just uninterested in politics. During any election, the candidates spend a lot of energy
               trying to get the mugwumps on their side.  If you were trying to make a decision with a group and no one would commit, you could say "Don‚Äôt be
               a bunch of mugwumps!"[0m
