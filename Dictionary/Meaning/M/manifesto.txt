[91m        SHORT  A manifesto is a public statement stating your views or your intention to do something. If you feel you should be voted "Most Likely to Succeed," you could
               issue a manifesto describing all the reasons why you deserve to win.[0m
[36m         LONG  Manifesto comes from the Italian word of the same spelling, meaning "public declaration explaining past actions and announcing the motive for forthcoming
               ones." You'll most often hear about a manifesto that's been issued by a group, like a political party or government ‚Äî for example, a set of new
               rules that an incoming regime is going to enforce. Though organizations are more likely to create a manifesto, it's also possible for an
               individual to issue one about more personal ideas.[0m
