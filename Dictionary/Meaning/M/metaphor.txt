                                                                                     METAPHOR                                                                                     
  SHORT        If you brag that "the world's your oyster," you're using a metaphor from Shakespeare, who knew a thing or two about figures of speech.
  LONG         Good writers know their way around a metaphor, where you make an analogy between two things to show how one resembles the other in some way. When a character
               from Shakespeare calls the world his oyster, that's his  boastful way of saying that all the riches of the world are his for the taking, like
               plucking a pearl from an oyster shell. Shakespeare also wrote, "All the world's a stage." Oyster? Stage? Come on, Will, get your metaphors
               straight!

     >         “Politics can be a moral arena where people come together to find common ground,” Jackson said, before moving on to an extended and illustrative metaphor.
     >         One way of combating this bewilderment is to look for metaphors.
     >         Financial planners used to talk about funding your senior years by using the metaphor of a three-legged stool.
     >         “The metaphor we use is that they’re chasing a fading star into the dark. They’re struggling for an end they may never see.”
     >         Whitehead’s well-built, stunningly daring novel turns the historical freedom network from metaphor to reality, complete with tracks, locomotives and
               platforms.
