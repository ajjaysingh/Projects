[91m        SHORT  If you brag that "the world's your oyster," you're using a metaphor from Shakespeare, who knew a thing or two about figures of speech.[0m
[36m         LONG  Good writers know their way around a metaphor, where you make an analogy between two things to show how one resembles the other in some way. When a character
               from Shakespeare calls the world his oyster, that's his  boastful way of saying that all the riches of the world are his for the taking, like
               plucking a pearl from an oyster shell. Shakespeare also wrote, "All the world's a stage." Oyster? Stage? Come on, Will, get your metaphors
               straight![0m
