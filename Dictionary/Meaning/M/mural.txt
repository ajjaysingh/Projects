[91m        SHORT  A mural is a large-scale painting usually done on a wall. Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist, is famous for the plaster murals he painted on the walls at
               Rockefeller Center in the 1930s.[0m
[36m         LONG  Famous murals include the wall designs in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican in Rome, and the Coit Tower murals in San Francisco. Many murals were created
               during the Renaissance, and again during the New Deal. They are also common features of urban settings ‚Äì‚Äì painted on the outsides of buildings
               and on playground walls.[0m

      Origin:  late Middle English: from French, from Latin muralis, from murus ‚Äòwall‚Äô. The adjective was first used in mural crown; later (mid 16th century) the sense
               ‚Äòplaced or executed on a wall‚Äô arose, reflected in the current noun use (dating from the early 20th century).
