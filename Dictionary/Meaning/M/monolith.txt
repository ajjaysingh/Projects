[91m        SHORT  When something is really huge, like a giant stone, building, or company, call it a monolith. You can also use it to describe a huge amount of work, like the
               monolith that is your 40-page term paper.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun monolith comes from the Greek words monos, meaning “single” and lithos, meaning “stone.” Any large structures, like a factory that could cover many
               football fields in size, can be called a monolith. So can monuments that have little definition, like Stonehenge. Even companies that seem to
               be everywhere, their products and neon-signed restaurants covering the globe, can be called monoliths.[0m
