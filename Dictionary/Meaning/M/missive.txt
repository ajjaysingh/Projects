                                                                                     MISSIVE                                                                                      
  SHORT        A missive usually refers to the old-school style of hand-written communication on paper (remember that?), but these days you also might hear an email called a
               missive, too. No matter how you deliver it, a missive is a message.
  LONG         The noun missive comes from the Latin word missus, meaning "to send."  You may have heard the phrase, "fire off a missive," meaning a note, memo or dispatch
               that was written and sent with urgency and conveyed an important message. It might have been a missive sent from a commander to the troops,
               telling them of a change in the battle plan. Or, maybe it was an urgent love letter to the commander's wife back home, telling her to tie a
               yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree...
                                                                            EXAMPLES FROM VOCABULARY:                                                                             
     >         Bloggers wrote disparagingly of Castro and the regime, although most of their missives could not be read in Cuba, where Internet access was strictly limited.
     >         I dug out Trump’s missive the other day and discovered he did not actually say I looked like a dog.
     >         People write concise missives on the leaves, then affix them to the branches, and what Ms. Christopher calls the Thankful Tree takes blazing form.
     >         Theallet did not respond to requests for comment on her missive on Nov. 18.
     >         The priority should be to strike America “until it bleeds to death both militarily and financially”, he said in a public missive.
