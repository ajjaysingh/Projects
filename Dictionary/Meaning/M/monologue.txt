[91m        SHORT  A monologue is a speech delivered by one person, or a long one-sided conversation that makes you want to pull your hair out from boredom.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Greek root word monologos translates to ‚Äúspeaking alone,‚Äù and that‚Äôs a monologue: one person doing all the talking.  In theatre, sometimes a character has
               a monologue that they perform.  You might have an internal monologue where you talk to yourself to better understand some dilemma. Some people
               talk forever in a constant monologue, never letting you speak.  If two people talk back and forth, it‚Äôs a dialogue, which is different and
               probably more fun for everyone.[0m
