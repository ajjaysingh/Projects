[91m        SHORT  Mercantilism, also called "commercialism,” is a system in which a country attempts to amass wealth through trade with other countries, exporting more than it
               imports and increasing stores of gold and precious metals. It is often considered an outdated system.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun mercantilism came from the Latin mercāns, or "buyer." It was a system that encouraged the idea of government trade regulation to gain wealth, a move
               away from agriculture system as an economic base. Although largely rejected today, it was the main school of economic thought from the 15th
               through the 18th Centuries, and was the push behind much of the exploration and colonization of other lands — and many of the wars — that
               happened during that time.[0m
