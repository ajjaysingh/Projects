[91m        SHORT  You might not want to call a mercenary a "hireling" to his face, but a mercenary is, after all, a soldier who gets paid to fight where needed, sometimes
               taking a heroic stand and other times just wanting payment for fighting.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word mercenary comes from the Latin mercƒìnƒÅrius, "hireling," which defines someone who will do anything in exchange for money. In history, a mercenary was
               often a fighter who followed the next paycheck, but in recent decades it's also been used for fighters who pursue a good cause in areas where
               soldiers are in short supply. A synonym for mercenary is "soldier of fortune," and this phrase sometimes glorifies the mercenary, turning the
               meaning of "fortune" from "cash" to "luck in battle."[0m
