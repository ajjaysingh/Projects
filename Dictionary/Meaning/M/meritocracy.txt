[36m         LONG  Meritocracy, coined in 1958 by Michael Young, is a combination of merit ("goodness worthy of praise or reward") and aristocracy, meaning "the highest class in
               certain societies." In a government based on meritocracy, the leaders are chosen because they are the smartest and have best judgment. They can
               come from the poorest, most humble background just as long as they are the most noble and fit to rule.[0m
