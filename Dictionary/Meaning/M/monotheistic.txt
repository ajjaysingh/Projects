[36m         LONG  These days the monotheistic religions — ones that believe in one god — are the most popular. But other religions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, are polytheistic
               — meaning they believe in many gods. Usually in a monotheistic religion, God (with a capital G) is an all-powerful being who created the
               universe and knows everything. Monotheistic religions tend to look at other types of believers as pagans, heathens, and heretics.[0m
