[36m         LONG  Mongrel has the Middle English root word mong, which meant "mix." If you use the word mongrel to refer to the mixed ancestry of a dog or other animal, you may
               or may not intend to be insulting. If you refer to a human as a mongrel, you are definitely making a pejorative comment about that person's
               origins. In this use, it is considered an insult.[0m
