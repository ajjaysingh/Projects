[91m        SHORT  Something that is menacing is threatening or suggestive of coming danger. If you’re backing away slowly from something, you can probably use the adjective
               menacing to describe it![0m
[36m         LONG  Menacing means “threatening” — whether it’s on purpose or not. A menacing tone is intended to scare you, but that menacing raincloud isn’t actually trying to
               ruin your day. Menacing can describe the behavior of a menace, but only the mean or dangerous kind — not just a pest: "The raccoon that always
               knocks over your garbage can is a menace, but it's not menacing (unless it also chases you around your house)."[0m
