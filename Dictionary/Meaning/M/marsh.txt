[91m        SHORT  A marsh is an area in transition from land to water. It is a very bad idea to go walking in a marsh in your best shoes; try some fishing boots, or perhaps a
               boat.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word marsh comes from the old Dutch word mere, for sea, and it means land that is sea-ish‚Ä¶ not sea, but sea-ish, like most of Holland. Marshes can be
               found often where a river empties into the sea, or along the side of a low, flooded river. Another word for marsh is swamp. If you‚Äôre in
               trouble or just want to be alone, a marsh is a great place to hide: no one will follow you. Just don‚Äôt forget your galoshes.[0m
