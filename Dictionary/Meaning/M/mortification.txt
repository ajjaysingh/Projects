[91m        SHORT  If you've ever gone an entire day with your fly unzipped, not realizing until after you've given a speech in front of a huge audience, you know what
               mortification feels like.[0m
[36m         LONG  Mortification is the feeling of being completely humiliated. The word mortification has its roots in the Latin word for "death," mors. The original meaning of
               mortification was religious; in Christianity the meaning is "putting your sin to death". In Christian practice, this has varied from denying
               oneself pleasurable things, like certain foods, to inflicting physical pain on oneself. The religious reason for this kind of mortification is
               to cause the "death" of sins ‚Äî or desires ‚Äî of the body.[0m
