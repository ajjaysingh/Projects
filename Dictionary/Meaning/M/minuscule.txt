[91m        SHORT  When something is teeny tiny, it is minuscule. If your mother calls your miniskirt minuscule, it probably means she wants you to change into something a bit

[36m         LONG  In minuscule, you see the word, minus, which means lesser. The word minuscule has its roots in the Latin expression minuscula littera, a phrase used to
               describe the smaller letters in text. In the late 1800s, the use of the word expanded to mean very small in general ‚Äî so the definition of
               minuscule became less minuscule.[0m
