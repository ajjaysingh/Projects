[91m        SHORT  If the first section of the newspaper you read is the obituaries, you could be considered morbid. Morbid is a word used to describe anyone who spends too much
               time thinking about death or disease.[0m
[36m         LONG  A lot of English words relating to medicine and science come from Latin, and the adjective morbid is one of them; it comes from the root morbidus, meaning
               "diseased" or "sick." Morbid can also be used to describe other nouns besides people. If you wear Goth clothing, your wardrobe might be
               described as morbid. And if you hang tombstones on your walls, your taste in art could also be described as morbid.[0m
