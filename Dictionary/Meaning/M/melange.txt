[91m        SHORT  Why call it a mixture when it can be a melange?  A tricolor vegetable melange makes even carrots, peas, and corn sound like gourmet cuisine. A melange is any
               combination of anything, but the word always heightens the glamour quotient.[0m
[36m         LONG  The French have a way of making simple words sound like romantic entreaties of love. Call any random assortment of things a melange, or as it's sometimes
               spelled, m√©lange, and voila, you've given it a sparkle that plain old words like combination, mixture, and blend just cannot convey. This word
               ‚Äî along with a melange of other attributes, like great bread and pastries, delicious wine, and fine fashion ‚Äî are all reasons why we love the
               French. All that accordion music? Not so much.[0m
