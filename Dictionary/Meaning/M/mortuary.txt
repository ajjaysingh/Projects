[36m         LONG  When a person dies in a hospital, his body is usually moved to a mortuary before an autopsy takes place. A mortuary is also where a body is kept until it's
               buried or cremated. Another word for a mortuary is a morgue, which is more commonly used in the United States. In the 1500's, mortuary was used
               as an adjective meaning "pertaining to death," from the Latin root word mortuus, or "dead."[0m
