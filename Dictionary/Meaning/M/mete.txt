[91m        SHORT  If you "mete out" something (the word is usually followed by "out"), it means you dish it out in very careful measured amounts. Anyone who metes out their
               love probably isn't someone you want to have a relationship with.[0m
[36m         LONG  Another word often used interchangeably with mete is dole, though there are slight differences in meaning: dole suggests a more lavish, unthinking form of
               activity than the more stingy and controlled mete, and while some nice things (like compassion or love) can be "doled out," it's very rare that
               anything pleasant or happy is "meted out."[0m
