[36m         LONG  The verb maim is related to mayhem, which, historically, was the act of hurting another person so badly that they couldn‚Äôt defend themselves. To maim a person
               or animal, even if it‚Äôs an accident, is to render them defenseless or disfigured, and it frequently includes the loss of a limb. The goal of
               driving defensively is to avoid an accident that could maim you, your passengers, or other people on the road.[0m
