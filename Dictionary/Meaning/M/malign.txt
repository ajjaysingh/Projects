[36m         LONG  When you habitually malign people, you risk being described as "a malign influence" ‚Äî in this case, malign is an adjective that describes a harmful or even
               evil person or thing. Whichever way you use the word, its connection to wickedness can be found in its Latin root, malignus, "wicked or bad-
               natured," which combines male, or "badly" and -gnus, "born."[0m
