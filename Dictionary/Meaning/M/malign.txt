  SHORT        If you malign someone, you badmouth them — just like the jilted girlfriend who tells the whole school her ex has bad breath and head lice.
  LONG         When you habitually malign people, you risk being described as "a malign influence" — in this case, malign is an adjective that describes a harmful or even
               evil person or thing. Whichever way you use the word, its connection to wickedness can be found in its Latin root, malignus, "wicked or bad-
               natured," which combines male, or "badly" and -gnus, "born."

     >         I feel relatively secure in my position, and angry that I do not have a voice in conversations that malign me.
     >         This is dispiriting to critics of the Western media who do not ascribe its failings to malign conspiracies.
     >         The Flames maligned special teams came up big in this one.
     >         The Flames, whose maligned special teams came up big in this one, have traded wins and losses for five games.
     >         Then remember all those stories about how this team, and its maligned quarterback, were unable to beat winning teams.
