[36m         LONG  Malevolent comes from the Latin word malevolens, which means "ill-disposed, spiteful"; its opposite is benevolent, which means "wishing good things for
               others."  A malevolent person might display satisfaction at someone else's problems. But it's not only individuals who can be malevolent. If
               you think that television violence influences viewers to violence, you see television as a malevolent force. The stress is on the second
               syllable: muh-LEV-uh-lent.[0m
