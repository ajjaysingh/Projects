[91m        SHORT  Motion is the way things get from place to place. The ball rolling down a hill is in motion, and as Isaac Newton once proved, it will remain in motion until
               it hits a wall or something else that makes it stop.[0m
[36m         LONG  When motion is used as a noun, it describes movement, like the motion that propels a car from one end of the highway to another. When used as a verb, motion
               means to signal or direct. "A restaurant patron will motion to the server when he's ready for the check." Someone who is just "going through
               the motions" doesn't have to move at all, because they're just pretending.[0m
