[91m        SHORT  If you like Edgar Allan Poe and "The Addams Family," you have a taste for mordant entertainment ‚Äî that is, anything particularly grim or dark in nature.[0m
[36m         LONG  The original meaning of mordant (which comes from the Latin word modere, meaning "to bite or sting,") was that of a physical substance that literally bit into
               something, such as the one used to set dye into fabrics, or etch lines into a copper plate. Now, mordant generally refers to a dark or biting
               artistic style, sense of humor, or psychological outlook.[0m
