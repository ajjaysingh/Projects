[91m        SHORT  Think of modal as relating to some "mode," or form. A modal verb is a helper that gives additional information about the verb that follows it, and includes
               such words as "can," "will," "should," and "may," among others.[0m
[36m         LONG  The English word modal has long been used as a term in logic and statistics, such as "modal values." Toward the end of that century, the term was used in
               music, suggesting a use of harmonies and melodies based on other than the standard major and minor scales, in a style found in medieval
               liturgical music. Modal logic, in philosophy, is a supposition or conclusion based on the ideas of probability and necessity rather than
               concrete fact.[0m
