[91m        SHORT  If you've got myriad problems it doesn't mean you should call a myriad exterminator, it means you've got countless problems; loads of them; too many to count.

[36m         LONG  Myriad is one of those words rarely used in speech but only in written form. You would usually use a phrase like "lots of" or "loads of" instead. I mean, you
               could say "I've got myriad problems," but everyone would probably just laugh at you, and rightly so. Originally from ancient Latin and Greek
               words meaning "ten thousand" ‚Äî so perhaps you can put a number on myriad, after all.[0m
