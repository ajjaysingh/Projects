  SHORT        A maverick is a rebel, someone who shows a lot of independence. A maverick on a motorcycle might blaze his own trail, or show a maverick touch in a rough
               sport by wearing a helmet with the word "Mom" inside a heart.
  LONG         Samuel A. Maverick owned a lot of cattle, and he let them roam around Texas without a brand, or identification mark, seared into their skins. Samuel was a
               maverick for going against the common practice of tracking his animals, and his last name became part of the English language as both an
               adjective and a noun in the 19th century. Someone who acts very independently is a maverick, and individual actions that stand out are
               maverick, as in "her maverick jumping style on the ice was both wild and delicate."

     >         New Orleans regained the lead on Anthony Davis’ two free throws, but Matthews made another 3-pointer to put the Mavericks ahead to stay.
     >         He had played in the Mavericks’ two most recent games.
     >         The Clippers had no problem putting away the Mavericks in a 124-104 victory on Wednesday night in Dallas.
     >         He acknowledged that he was a maverick, but he insisted that his methods were appropriate.
     >         Tra-Deon Hollins dished out eight assists and was one of three Mavericks to finish just short of double figures with nine points.
