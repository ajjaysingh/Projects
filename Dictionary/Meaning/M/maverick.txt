[91m        SHORT  A maverick is a rebel, someone who shows a lot of independence. A maverick on a motorcycle might blaze his own trail, or show a maverick touch in a rough
               sport by wearing a helmet with the word "Mom" inside a heart.[0m
[36m         LONG  Samuel A. Maverick owned a lot of cattle, and he let them roam around Texas without a brand, or identification mark, seared into their skins. Samuel was a
               maverick for going against the common practice of tracking his animals, and his last name became part of the English language as both an
               adjective and a noun in the 19th century. Someone who acts very independently is a maverick, and individual actions that stand out are
               maverick, as in "her maverick jumping style on the ice was both wild and delicate."[0m
