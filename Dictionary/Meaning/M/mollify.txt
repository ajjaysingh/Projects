[91m        SHORT  To mollify is to calm someone down, talk them off the ledge, make amends, maybe even apologize.[0m
[36m         LONG  Mollify comes from the Latin mollificare to "make soft," and that's still at the heart the word. When you mollify someone, you smooth things over, even if
               you're maybe still a little mad: "I was angry that the guy took my seat, but I was mollified when he offered me one closer to the band." Unlike
               the sharp sounds of antagonize, there are only soft sounds in this word that means to make someone feel soft and cuddly. Although dryer sheets
               might soften your clothes, they don't mollify them (unless your clothes were really mad at you before).[0m
