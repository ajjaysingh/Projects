[91m        SHORT  Ever climb a ladder and then, when you’re at the top, the ladder tips over, leaving you stranded up there?  That’s the start of a misadventure, an unfortunate
               situation that happens because of bad luck.[0m
[36m         LONG  Kids are always having misadventures. Falling into a pit of mud, getting stuck between slats in a fence, a monkey stealing the shirt off your back: all
               classic misadventures. The word is rooted in the French word mesaventure, which translates to “turn out badly.” Some misadventures are only
               embarrassing, while others are exhausting and sad. The worst part? You can’t prevent a misadventure, because they happen by chance.[0m
