[91m        SHORT  Your minions, if you are lucky enough to have any, are those people who are devoted to you and entirely dependent on you. If you borrow money from a bully and
               don't pay it back, he might send one of his minions after you.[0m
[36m         LONG  A minion is nothing more than a yes-man, a nameless faceless servant. It is a negative term implying that your only importance is from the person who orders
               you around. Corporate presidents may have minions to do their dirty work such as firing employees who have made a mistake. If a celebrity comes
               to town, minions will come ahead of time to make sure that everything is to the celebrity's liking.[0m
