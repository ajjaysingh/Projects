[36m         LONG  One complication of owning a boat is that you need to rent a mooring for it, a place to keep it while you're not out on the water. Piers, docks, and wharfs
               all typically provide moorings for boats and ships, where they can be attached securely with ropes. Mooring comes from the verb moor, "to
               fasten by cable," from a Germanic root.[0m
