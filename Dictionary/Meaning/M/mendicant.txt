[91m        SHORT  People who live off begging can be called mendicants. However, you probably wouldn't call your kids mendicants, even though they beg you for stuff, because
               the word mendicant also implies extreme poverty.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun mendicant can also refer to a man belonging to a religious order, such as the Franciscan Friars ‚Äî who do not own personal property but live together
               in a monastery and survive off alms donated by others. As an adjective, mendicant describes someone who lives such an existence.[0m
