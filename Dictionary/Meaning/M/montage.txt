[91m        SHORT  Romantic comedies always seem to include a montage of scenes showing the main characters falling in love while sharing a hot dog, playfully throwing snowballs
               at each other, and taking a romantic ride on a boat. A montage is a film sequence made up of many short scenes edited together.[0m
[36m         LONG  A montage is a kind of collage, often assembled from many different movie scenes, resulting in a single overall theme or image. You can also make a montage of
               photographs or music, editing or pasting together various bits to form one continuous whole. In the movie business, the word montage was
               originally used to mean "edit," the process of cutting and pasting pieces of film together to form a finished product.[0m
