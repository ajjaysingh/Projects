[36m         LONG  You can be mischievous in harmless, playful ways, or you might also use the word mischievous to describe behavior that's more than just a little naughty. If
               you post online some embarrassing photos of an acquaintance, your more generous friends might describe your behavior as mischievous, although
               others might accuse you of being downright mean. Keep in mind that the word has only three syllables: MIS-chuh-vuhs.[0m

      Origin:  Middle English: from Anglo-Norman French meschevous, from Old French meschever ‚Äòcome to an unfortunate end‚Äô (see mischief). The early sense was ‚Äòunfortunate
               or calamitous‚Äô, later ‚Äòhaving harmful effects‚Äô; the sense ‚Äòplayfully troublesome‚Äô dates from the late 17th century.
