[36m         LONG  In Latin, mori means "to die." You probably recognize this root in words like mortal, mortician, and mortuary. Moribund means "near death," but it can also
               mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over the Internet becomes a more and
               more popular way to watch movies and television shows, the DVD has become a moribund medium.[0m
