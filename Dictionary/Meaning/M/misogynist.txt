[91m        SHORT  If you're someone who believes women belong in the kitchen and shouldn't be accorded the same respect as men, you might be a misogynist. A misogynist is a
               person who hates or doesn't trust women.[0m
[36m         LONG  Misogynist is from Greek misogyn·∏ós, from the prefix miso- "hatred" plus gyn·∏ó "a woman." The English suffix -ist means "person who does something." The prefix
               mis-, a variant of miso- before a vowel, appears in the opposite term misandrist, which is a person who hates or doesn't trust men. The
               corresponding nouns are mysogyny and misandry.[0m
