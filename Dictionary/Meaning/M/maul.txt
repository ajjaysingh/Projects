[91m        SHORT  Maul is both the name of a heavy hammer, and also a verb meaning beating and scratching. Tigers, lions, bears‚Äì‚Äìanimals with powerful paws and sharp claws,
               will maul their victims.[0m
[36m         LONG  The maul came to be used as a weapon in the late Middle Ages‚Äì‚Äìif your opponent is wearing armor that a steel sword-blade can't penetrate, you can still
               inflict damage by mauling them with a hammer. You might not be able to stab your opponent, but at least you can maul them.[0m
