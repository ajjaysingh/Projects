[91m        SHORT  Use the word musty to describe an unclean, stale and possibly moldy smell. If something smells musty that means it‚Äôs probably been sitting in a damp corner
               without any air for a little too long.[0m
[36m         LONG  Musty smells take time to develop: they‚Äôre caused by dampness and mold, and signal some amount of decay. You might also call the smell of a musty old basement
               rank or foul. But people also use musty to insult someone‚Äôs writing, or their ideas. A musty speech wouldn‚Äôt just be old-fashioned, it would be
               old in a bad way: rotten and boring.[0m
