[91m        SHORT  To moor is to tie up a ship, as in to moor the ocean liner to the docks. Or, if you're reading Victorian literature, a moor could be a mossy meet-up spot.[0m
[36m         LONG  This word of many hats can also be a noun ‚Äî a moor is mossy land covered in bushes and grass. The spooky dogs in Sherlock Holmes's The Hound of the
               Baskervilles lurk in the moor. With a capital "M," a Moor can refer to a person descended from Muslims of northwestern Africa. It's usually
               used as a verb, though, meaning to fasten a boat ‚Äî probably related to the Old English word m√¶rels "mooring rope."  Say the word in a deep
               voice and it almost sounds like the foghorn on a ship that's about to moor in the harbor on a foggy night.[0m
