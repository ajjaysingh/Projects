[91m        SHORT  Merit means "worthiness or excellence." If you receive a certificate of merit in school, you are being recognized for doing a good job. As a verb, merit means
               "deserve." Your certificate might merit a prominent place on your bulletin board![0m

               job‚Äì‚Äìand not job performance‚Äì‚Äìdetermines when workers are promoted and how much they are paid. Using the word merit suggests impartiality and
               objectivity‚Äì‚Äìsuch as when you swear off a prejudiced approach to something and vow to "judge it on its merits."[0m
