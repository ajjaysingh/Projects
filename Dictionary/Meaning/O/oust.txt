[36m         LONG  When you oust someone, you are “giving them the boot.” A sports team is ousted from a tournament if they lose an elimination round. Oust often implies both
               removal and replacement. The automobile, for instance, ousted the horse as the preferred means of travel. Likewise, when a politician ousts
               someone from office they are taking that person’s place in office. And if you beat the all-time record in a hot-dog eating tournament, then you
               oust the previous record holder from their position.[0m
