[36m         LONG  This word covers things that are slightly off-kilter, like odd numbers. You can use odd for a single thing that belongs in a pair, like an odd sock or odd
               mitten. If someone wants you to do odd jobs, that could mean almost anything: odd jobs are random and unpredictable jobs that could come up.
               When you describe a person as odd, or that they‚Äôre exhibiting odd behavior, it means they're peculiar and out of the ordinary.[0m
