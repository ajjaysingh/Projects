[91m        SHORT  In medicine, obstetrics is the specialty that focuses on pregnancy and childbirth. A pregnant woman usually chooses a doctor or midwife who works in
               obstetrics.[0m
[36m         LONG  Doctors who care for patients before, during, and just after the birth of a baby are called obstetricians, and their field is obstetrics. Many of these
               doctors also practice as gynecologists ‚Äî specialists in all women's medicine. The earliest definition of obstetrics is "the science of
               midwifery," from the Modern Latin obstetricus, "pertaining to a midwife," which has the root word obstetrix, "midwife," or literally "one who
               stands opposite."[0m
