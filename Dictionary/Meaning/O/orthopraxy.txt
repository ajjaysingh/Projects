	Wiki Definition:
              	In the study of religion,  orthopraxy  is correct conduct, both ethical and liturgical, as opposed to faith or grace etc. This contrasts with orthodoxy, which
               emphasizes correct belief, and ritualism, the use of rituals. The word is a neoclassical compound—ὀρθοπραξία (orthopraxia) meaning 'correct
               practice'.
