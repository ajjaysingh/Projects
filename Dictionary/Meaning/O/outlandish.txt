[91m        SHORT  If something is outlandish it's bizarre or unfamiliar, far outside the boundaries of expected or normal behavior. Driving around the city in a golf cart and
               eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce are both examples of outlandish behavior.[0m
[36m         LONG  It's easy to imagine how the word outlandish originated. The Old English root is utland, which literally means "out-land," or foreign.  Now, it would be
               inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather Speedo and a ten-gallon
               hat.[0m
