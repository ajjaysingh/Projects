[91m        SHORT  Though officious sounds like official, it means being annoyingly eager to do more than is required. "The officious lunch lady made everyone's food choices her

[36m         LONG  Officious is a tricky word as it seems like it might mean something like office or official. Instead, it is a word to describe someone that acts more official
               than they actually are. People who are officious are busybodies. They want to make their opinions known and followed, despite not having any
               kind of real power.[0m
