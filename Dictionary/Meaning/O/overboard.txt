[36m         LONG  The adverb overboard most often comes up when someone falls in the water. When it's used literally, it very specifically refers to the movement of a person or
               an object from a boat into the ocean or other body of water. Figuratively, to go overboard means to take something too far ‚Äî you're going
               overboard on your diet if you refuse to eat anything that isn't green.[0m
