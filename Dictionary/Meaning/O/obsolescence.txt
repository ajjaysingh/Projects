[91m        SHORT  Fashion trends come and go, and often return after a time. But gimmicky fads quickly fall into obsolescence, losing appeal and falling out of sight — do you
               know anyone who still has a pet rock?[0m
[36m         LONG  The word obsolescence is the noun form of the more common obsolete, meaning "something no longer used." Both words stem from the Latin obsolēscere, which
               means, logically enough, "to fall into disuse." Your phone or your car may be designed for obsolescence, meaning they are meant to stop working
               or go out of style so you'll buy a newer model. More amusingly, TV personality Art Linkletter once commented, "The four stages of man are
               infancy, childhood, adolescence, and obsolescence.”[0m

[3m             > Others shed their obsolescence via social media or through dishy interviews in the saturated but never-satisfied content maw that is the internet, reclaiming
