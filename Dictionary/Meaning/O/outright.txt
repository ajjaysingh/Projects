[91m        SHORT  If you do something outright, you do it in a wholehearted, unrestricted way. If you declare outright that you‚Äôre never eating another cupcake, that‚Äôs the end

[36m         LONG  If an event is cancelled outright, there's no question about it being rescheduled, and if you buy a new car outright, you pay for it all at once, instead of
               making monthly payments. Outright means direct and immediate ‚Äî whether it's an adverb or an adjective: "The child's outright refusal to put on
               his shoes exasperated his babysitter." It can also mean ‚Äúright away.‚Äù If you step on a slug, you‚Äôll probably kill it outright. Ew.[0m
