[91m        SHORT  Onslaught is a military term that refers to an attack against an enemy. It's safe to say that no one wants to be caught on the receiving end of an onslaught,
               because there will be lots of danger, destruction and probably death.[0m
[36m         LONG  One way to help you remember the brutal meaning of onslaught is through the word's English origin, slaught, meaning "slaughter." But onslaught can be used in
               non-military ways, too. It can mean a barrage of written or spoken communication, like an onslaught of emailed birthday wishes. Taken
               individually, the birthday wishes are nice but an onslaught is too many, too fast, all at once. Onslaught can also mean a sudden and severe
               start of trouble. For example, if your office is unprepared for the onslaught of flu season, the entire sales force will be home sick at the
               same time.[0m
