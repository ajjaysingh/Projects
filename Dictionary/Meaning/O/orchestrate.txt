[36m         LONG  An orchestra is a large group of classical musicians led by a conductor: it consists of many people playing together. Similarly, when we talk about
               orchestrating, someone is coordinating the activities of many people to accomplish something. The manager of an office orchestrates the
               business. A coach orchestrates the play of the team. Terrorist leaders orchestrate attacks. Orchestrating is like directing, and it applies to
               many more things than just music.[0m
