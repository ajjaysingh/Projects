[36m         LONG  Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean "dark, dim," "unclear, hard to understand," or "insignificant, humble." We tend to use obscure in the
               metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and
               probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing
               twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.[0m
