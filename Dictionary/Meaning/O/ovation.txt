[91m        SHORT  Hear that applause and cries of "Bravo"? Your audience is giving you an ovation, or praise for a great performance.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun ovation has origins in the Latin word ovare, meaning "exult, rejoice, triumph.‚Äù Ancient Romans used it to describe a ceremony honoring a general
               entering Rome following a minor triumph. By the nineteenth century ovation had taken on the more specific meaning: a display of appreciation
               and applause from an audience. Today, especially great performers get standing ovations, which means the audience rises from their seats as
               they clap.[0m
