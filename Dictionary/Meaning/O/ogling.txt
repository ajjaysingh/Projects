                                                                                      OGLING                                                                                      
  SHORT        When you ogle someone, you look at them with love or desire in mind. And if you're a cartoon character, you might also be drooling.
  LONG         Though it's most often used to refer to the way people gaze at each other, the verb ogle can also be used when talking about any object of desire — like when
               you ogle those designer jeans or that red Ferrari. The word comes from the 1680s German word oeglen, meaning "look at." Men are known to ogle
               women much more frequently than women ogle men. Ever seen a scene in a movie where a pretty lady walks into a bar and all the men turn on their
               bar stools to watch her pass by? That's classic ogling.
                                                                            EXAMPLES FROM VOCABULARY:                                                                             
     >         It doesn't matter -- to me all I see is a sea of faces ogling me.
     >         There is pervy behavior, like leering and ogling, which is immoral but not illegal.
     >         Context is important: Someone could say "God bless you, baby" to a woman while ogling her and that would be "just another come-on," Stark writes.
     >         For enthusiasts, there was much ogling at under-the-hood advancements of the combustible engine.
     >         Kardashian was there, though, ogling her sculpture double’s exposed bottom along with everyone else.
