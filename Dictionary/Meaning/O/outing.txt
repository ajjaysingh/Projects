[36m         LONG  A summer outing might be a picnic or a day at the beach, while a winter outing could consist of a hike in the snow or a shopping trip and lunch at a
               restaurant. Any brief, fun journey can be called an outing. In the fourteenth century, an outing was simply the "action of going out," and in
               the fifteenth century it started to mean "act of putting out" as well. By the 1800s it had gained today's definition.[0m
