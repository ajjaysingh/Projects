[91m        SHORT  Think of something crushing you, and you will understand what oppressive is. It can be something that crushes your spirit, like a bad relationship, or
               something that crushes you with its tyranny, like the oppressive rule of a  dictator.[0m
[36m         LONG  Oppressive comes in many flavors; laws can be oppressive, governments can be oppressive, even relationships can be oppressive. The adjective oppressive is
               heavy stuff; it can feel like you can't breathe, like something is choking you: "His oppressive behavior made me feel like I was being
               smothered."  If something is just too intense, and not in a good way, that also can feel oppressive.[0m
