[36m         LONG  If you‚Äôre giving an oration, make sure you show up prepared. An oration is a speech that‚Äôs planned in advance rather than made up on the spot. It usually has
               a formal tone and is presented at a ceremony of some kind. You probably remember nervously sitting through an oration at your graduation
               ceremony, or you may have listened to a funeral oration celebrating the life of a famous person.[0m
