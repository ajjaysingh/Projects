[36m         LONG  Do you know people who are loud, over-the-top, and always walking into a room like they're a big deal? Well, they're acting ostentatiously and being
               ostentatious. That kind of behavior is usually considered obnoxious and pretentious, unless you're a king who has to wear gilded robes or a
               rock star who has to, well, behave like a rock star. Acting ostentatiously onstage might be necessary. But offstage, they're probably just
               attention hogs.[0m
