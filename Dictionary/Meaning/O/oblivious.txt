                                                                                    OBLIVIOUS                                                                                     
  SHORT        If you don't notice or aren't aware, it means that the adjective oblivious applies to you!
  LONG         When we think of the adjective oblivious, it is usually in situations that involve being totally unaware of what's staring us right in the face. It can also
               mean being forgetful and absent-minded. The cartoon character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example of someone who is oblivious; his eyesight is so
               bad that he always gets himself into various scrapes and mishaps. For example, Mr. Magoo mistakes an airplane for a theater and instead of
               watching a movie, he takes a seat on a departing airplane!

     >         Not all are oblivious to the legitimate concerns it sought to address, however.
     >         On my way in, I paused for a herd of elk that were oblivious to rush-hour traffic.
     >         He seemed indifferent, or oblivious of our presence.
     >         Oblivious to the good news, Flyer hops down the hall on three legs, eager to find her owner.
     >         But she seemed oblivious, moving nimbly around the cabin in search of her outdoor seat cushions.
