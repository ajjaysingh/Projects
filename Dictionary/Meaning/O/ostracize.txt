[36m         LONG  Ostraka is an ancient Greek word for pottery shard.  Thousands of years ago, in the Greek city of Athens, there was a public process where you would write the
               name of someone you wanted to kick out of town on a broken ceramic fragment.  If enough Athenians wrote the same name, that person was sent
               away for ten years. This process was called an ostracism.[0m
