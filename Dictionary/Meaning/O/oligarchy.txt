[91m        SHORT  Does it ever feel like just a few people have all the power? If it's a government that's run like this, it's an oligarchy. A country that has this form of
               government is an oligarchy too.[0m
[36m         LONG  The political term, oligarchy, comes to English from the Greek with its meaning intact - a form of government run by a small number of people such as wealthy
               landowners, royalty or powerful military figures. If you say that you can't fight the oligarchy, you mean the leaders of such a place.
               Sometimes the word refers to the few powerful people in charge of a large company or system. A financial oligarchy might try to block reform.[0m
