[91m        SHORT  Obdurate is a formal word meaning stubborn. If you want to major in English, but your parents are obdurate that you should go premed, they might go so far as

[36m         LONG  This adjective descends from Latin obdurare "to harden." A near synonym is adamant, from Latin adamas "hard metal, diamond." So both of these synonyms derive
               from the quality of hardness being associated with a stubborn personality.[0m
