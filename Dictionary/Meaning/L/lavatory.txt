[36m         LONG  Lavatory is a slightly formal way to say "bathroom." Most people would never refer to this room in their own homes as a lavatory, although they might use this
               word for public restrooms in schools, hospitals, or other buildings. In the U.K., a lavatory is just a toilet, and its earliest meaning was
               "washbasin," from the Latin root lavatorium, or "place for washing."[0m
