[91m        SHORT  If you walk unevenly, you have a limp. Maybe you pulled your hamstring at the annual Thanksgiving Day Football Showdown, or maybe one leg is three inches
               shorter than the other. Whatever the reason, if your gait is off kilter, you limp.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can have a limp (the noun), or you can limp (the verb), and both mean that for some reason your legs donâ€™t work quite in synch. Limp can also be an
               adjective that means "not strong or firm," like your friends' limp response to your invitation to come help paint your house or when your hair
               looks limp, meaning it's just hanging, with no volume or style.[0m
