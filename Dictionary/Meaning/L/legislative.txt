[91m        SHORT  Legislative is an adjective that describes the act or process of passing laws. Congress is the legislative branch of the United States government. They're the
               ones who can pass bills, which the president can sign into law or veto.[0m
[36m         LONG  A legislator is someone charged with creating and passing new laws in the legislature. All of these words come from the same root words — lex and legis
               (meaning "law") and lator (meaning "proposer"). So a legislator is literally a proposer of law, and their actions are legislative in nature. If
               you are interested in the legislative process, you might consider going to law school and running for office. Or you might just enjoy a movie
               about politics instead.[0m
