[91m        SHORT  Leaven, as a noun, is that which causes transformation. It‚Äôs the source of yeast that makes your bread rise, it‚Äôs the risen bread, and it‚Äôs anything that

[36m         LONG  Coming from the French verb levare, which means ‚Äúto raise,‚Äù leaven changes everything. It makes dough go from flat to loaf, and it‚Äôs also the term to describe
               the risen dough before it‚Äôs baked. And leaven can be anything that causes transformation ‚Äî "Winning the lottery will be the leaven that allows
               you to travel the world." Additionally it‚Äôs a verb: "When you bake bread, you leaven the dough to make it rise."[0m
