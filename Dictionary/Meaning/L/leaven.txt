                                                                                      LEAVEN                                                                                      
  SHORT        Leaven, as a noun, is that which causes transformation. It’s the source of yeast that makes your bread rise, it’s the risen bread, and it’s anything that
               changes the nature of something else.
  LONG         Coming from the French verb levare, which means “to raise,” leaven changes everything. It makes dough go from flat to loaf, and it’s also the term to describe
               the risen dough before it’s baked. And leaven can be anything that causes transformation — "Winning the lottery will be the leaven that allows
               you to travel the world." Additionally it’s a verb: "When you bake bread, you leaven the dough to make it rise."
