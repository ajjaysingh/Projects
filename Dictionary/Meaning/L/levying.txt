                                                                                     LEVYING                                                                                      
  SHORT        Use the word levy as you would use the word tax: “When the state government imposed a levy on soft drinks, thousands of citizens took to the streets in
               protest.”
  LONG         The word levy can act as either a verb or a noun in a sentence. The noun levy refers to a charge, such as a tax, fine, or other fee, that is imposed on
               something. The verb levy is used to describe the act of imposing or collecting the charge. If you need to raise money, for example, you may
               decide to levy a fine on your family every time you have to make the coffee in the morning. (Be careful though: your family may also take to
               the streets in protest.)
