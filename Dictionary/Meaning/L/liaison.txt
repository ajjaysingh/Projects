[91m        SHORT  Employ the French-sounding word liaison to refer to a relationship, a link between people or groups who aids communication.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are two main definitions for liaison that stem from Old French and before that, the Latin word for "to bind." The first definition refers in general to
               a connection or a relationship that serves effective communication. The second definition refers more specifically to an illicit relationship,
               or an affair, and can have a negative connotation.[0m
