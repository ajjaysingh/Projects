[36m         LONG  The word legislature comes from the Latin word for "law" ‚Äî legis. In the US, each state has a legislature ‚Äî made up of the elected state senators and
               assemblymen or women, or representatives. The US Congress is the national legislature. These bodies, whose members are often referred to as
               "law-makers," make up the legislative branch of government, as distinct from the executive and judicial branches.[0m
