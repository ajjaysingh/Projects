[91m        SHORT  Lavish means generous and extravagant as an adjective and to give generously as a verb. If you don't like it when people lavish you with attention, you might
               appreciate a lavish spread of excellent food instead.[0m
[36m         LONG  Lavish comes from the Old French lavache meaning "deluge, torrent" referring to rain. When you see it, think of a shower of good things coming down on you as
               you never use lavish with something bad. Didn't your parents lavish you with praise and love when you were small? With lavish as an adjective,
               you can rephrase that question like this: Didn't your parents offer you lavish praise and love when you were little?[0m
