[91m        SHORT  To lay is to set something down or put it in a horizontal position. It can also mean to position or prepare something for action, or, simply, to lay eggs.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word lay can mean a lot of different things, but one of its most common uses is as the adjective component of layperson, which refers to someone who's not
               a member of the clergy, or who's not a member of a particular profession and so cannot always understand that profession's technical jargon.
               This is why we sometimes request things to be communicated in "lay language," meaning simple, everyday terms that a layperson can understand.[0m
