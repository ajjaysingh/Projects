[91m        SHORT  If you drink a lot, eat a lot, and live a wild and unrestrained life, you might be called a  libertine.[0m
[36m         LONG  A libertine is someone who lives life unencumbered by morals. Although it can be used neutrally, often if someone calls you a libertine, they disapprove of
               your lack of morality. In the fourteenth century, a libertine was "a freed slave," from the Latin liber, "free." Starting in the mid-1500s,
               libertine had a religious and political connotation, referring to group that opposed Calvinism. By the nineteenth century, the word became
               strongly associated with immorality and debauchery.[0m
