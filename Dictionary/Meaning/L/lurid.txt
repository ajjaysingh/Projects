[36m         LONG  An expression used to avoid hearing or seeing disturbing things is "spare me the lurid details" or "spare me the gory details," and people say that so they
               won't have shocking or ugly images put into their imaginations. The word lurid, which entered English in the 17th century, comes from Latin
               l≈´ridis, "ghastly, pale yellow." All of the synonyms for the adjective lurid describe qualities that can turn a person pale: dreadful,
               nightmarish, and horrific, among others. Lurid is just a uniquely dark and gruesome word.[0m
