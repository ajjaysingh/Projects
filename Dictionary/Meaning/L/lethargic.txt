[36m         LONG  Being lethargic makes it hard to get anything done: you feel weak and sleepy. Whatever the reason, a lethargic person needs to snap out of it and get some
               energy, maybe by eating something or by taking a nap. Being lethargic also goes well with watching TV, since that takes almost no energy at
               all. When you feel lethargic, you don't have any energy to spare.[0m
