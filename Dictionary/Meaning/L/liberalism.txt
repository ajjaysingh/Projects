[91m        SHORT  Liberalism in politics favors social progress, through the agency of government, while liberalism in economics favors a free and open market, without
               government interference.[0m
[36m         LONG  Liberalism in contemporary politics is said to fall on the left-hand side of the political spectrum, which is why its adherents are sometimes called,
               collectively, "the Left." (Adherents of "conservatism" are called "the Right," and they are generally strongly opposed to liberalism.)
               "Political liberalism," which may favor more government regulation, is not interchangeable with "economic liberalism," which favors less
               government regulation, a strategy political conservatism often agrees with.[0m
