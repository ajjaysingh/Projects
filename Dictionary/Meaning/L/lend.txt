               that your trench coat lends itself to walking through a foggy city at dusk.[0m

      Origin:  Old English l«£nan, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch lenen, also to loan1. The addition of the final -d in late Middle English was due to association with
               verbs such as bend and send .
