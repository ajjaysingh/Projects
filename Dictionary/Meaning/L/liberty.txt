[36m         LONG  The phrase "give me liberty or give me death" is attributed to Patrick Henry, whose 1775 speech persuaded the Virginia colony to raise troops to fight the
               British in the American Revolutionary War. For sailors and naval officers, liberty means shore leave ‚Äî a brief vacation on land between
               voyages. We also use this noun to describe the act of getting a little too familiar or personal with someone, or doing something before we have
               their approval or permission.[0m
