[91m        SHORT  A legion is a horde or a large number of people or things. It was originally a term for a military unit.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Roman times, a legion was a large unit of men in the army, and the word is still used in many militaries. However, it also means a whole bunch of people
               doing anything. If someone has many fans, you can say legion of fans or legions of fans, but either way, that's a lot of fans. There are
               legions of stars in the sky. When you see legion, you can be sure there's an awful lot of something.[0m
