[36m         LONG  From Greek origins meaning "entreaty" or "supplication," litany often refers to certain long responsive petitions offered to God, particularly by
               practitioners of the Christian faith. For some reason, litany is usually used in reference to negative things ‚Äî such as a litany of complaints
               or a litany of injuries.[0m
