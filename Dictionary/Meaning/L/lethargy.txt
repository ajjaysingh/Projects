[91m        SHORT  Is your pet slug always this comatose, or is this display of lethargy unusual? The word lethargy describes inactivity or a lack of energy.[0m
[36m         LONG  Lethargy comes from the Greek lethargos, originally meaning ‚Äúinactive through forgetfulness.‚Äù Somewhere along the way, the word lost the implication of
               ‚Äúforgetfulness‚Äù and just ended up hanging around in bed all day. Still, lethargy doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply laziness; it can be brought about by
               illness and may also describe a lack of strength. Other lethargic nouns include torpor, sluggishness, and languor.[0m
