[91m        SHORT  A levee is an embankment, like a dam, constructed to prevent the overflow of a body of water. It can also mean a formal reception. How do these two words

               When you raise up dirt or other materials to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings––but you might
               hear of “a governor’s levee at the state capital.” And levee can be used as a verb, meaning to make an embankment, or shore up.[0m
