[36m         LONG  A leprechaun is typically described as a short old man with a beard, usually wearing a green coat and hat. In Celtic or Irish mythology, leprechauns are
               shoemakers who store gold coins at the ends of rainbows and love practical jokes. The root of the word leprechaun is the Irish leipreach√°n,
               which comes from the Old Irish luchorpan, literally "a very small body."[0m
