                                                                                      LIABLE                                                                                      
  SHORT        If you drive into someone's fence, you’ll probably be held liable — legally responsible — for fixing it. Liable can also mean “likely,” usually with something
               unpleasant: "If you don't brush your teeth, they're liable to fall out."
  LONG         When liable refers to legal responsibility, it's used with "for": "You're liable for the court costs" (meaning you have to pay them). When liable means
               "likely," it's with "to": "If you build your house on that cliff, it's liable to fall into the river," or "That part of town is liable to
               mudslides." Don't confuse liable with libel, which is a legal term for slander, or saying something false and damaging about someone.
