  SHORT        Literally, a linchpin is the pin that goes through the axle of a wheel to keep it in place, but linchpin can be used to mean an important part of anything,
               the thing that holds it all together.
  LONG         The linchpin is something that supports and holds another thing together. It’s the most important part of anything — eating well is the linchpin to staying
               healthy. A basketball team's most valuable player is the linchpin. The most crucial part of a plan is the linchpin. If something or someone is
               indispensable, she’s the linchpin. Take away the linchpin and everything falls apart.
