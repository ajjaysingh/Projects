[91m        SHORT  When someone lingers, he or she takes an unexpectedly long time to depart, as Romeo lingers when bidding Juliet farewell (or as annoying houseguests almost
               always tend to do).[0m
[36m         LONG  In addition to its primary meaning of "taking a long time to depart," linger has the additional meaning of "persisting while gradually weakening." In this
               sense, linger can refer to feelings or sensations that slowly fade away, like the smell of perfume that lingers in an elevator after the
               passengers have exited.[0m
