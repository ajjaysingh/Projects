[36m         LONG  This word suggests a strong feeling of disgust. Near synonyms are abhor and detest. The verb loathe descends from Middle English lothen, from Old English
               lƒÅthian. The related adjective loathsome means "hateful or disgusting," and the adjective loath means "not willing to do something," as in "I'm
               loath to cheat on a test, but I don't see what choice I have."[0m
