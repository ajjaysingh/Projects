[91m        SHORT  The adjective leeward describes an area or side of a boat that's facing away from the wind. If you move to the leeward side of your sailboat, you're shifting
               to the sheltered, downwind side.[0m
[36m         LONG  You're likely to hear the word leeward when you're on a boat, since wind direction is hugely important when you're sailing. You can, however, use it to
               describe any area that's protected from the wind, even when you're on land. Your tent might fare best if you pitch it on the leeward side of a
               valley, for example. The lee part of leeward comes from the Old English hleo, which means "shelter, defense, or protection."[0m
