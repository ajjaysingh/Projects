[91m        SHORT  To legislate is to make laws. If you thought there should be a law that all money should be pink instead of green, you might write to your congresswoman with

[36m         LONG  Formal government bodies legislate. So, while you might create a rule at home to ban phone calls at dinner, the House of Representatives would legislate
               communication regulations during meals. Legislate may seem like a tricky word, but you can easily remember the meaning if you notice that the
               word begins with the same leg as the word legal does; both words relate to the law.[0m
