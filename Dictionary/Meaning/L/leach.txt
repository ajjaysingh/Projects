[91m        SHORT  When minerals or other materials are pulled out of some substance by a liquid, you can say that they leach from it. A flood can leach important nutrients out
               of a farmer's field.[0m
[36m         LONG  In agriculture, when farmers allow cattle to graze too much in one spot, or don't rotate their crops from field to field over the years, they risk having a
               heavy rain leach nutrients from the soil. Sometimes farmers will use water to deliberately leach unwanted materials, like salt, from a field.
               The verb leach has an Old English root word, leccan, or "to moisten, water, wet, or irrigate."[0m
