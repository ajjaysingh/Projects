[91m        SHORT  A lair is a wild animal's den. If you ever find yourself in a forest and face to face with a bear trying to lure you into his lair, beware! He may be plotting
               to eat you.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun lair has its roots in the Old English leger, meaning ‚Äúbed, couch, place of lying down.‚Äù It eventually became an ‚Äúanimal‚Äôs den‚Äù in the early 15th
               century. A person can have a lair, too, like the photo-covered basement of a serial killer, or a less scary person might have a cozy lair lined
               with plush carpet. Always poke a stick into a lair before going in, because you never know what sort of beast is lurking inside.[0m
