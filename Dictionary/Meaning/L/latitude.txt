[91m        SHORT  Use the word latitude to describe how much freedom you have in making choices. For example, if a teacher gives you latitude in writing your paper, you might

[36m         LONG  Latitude is related to the Latin word latitudo, meaning "breadth, width, extent, size." You might already know that latitude is used to indicate the distance
               an object is from the equator, measured from north to south. Latitude can also be used to mean "be given the space to act and decide for
               oneself," like the latitude parents might give responsible kids.[0m
