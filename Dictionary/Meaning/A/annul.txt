[91m        SHORT  When a celebrity wakes up in Las Vegas with a mysterious wedding ring on her finger, the first thing she’ll probably want to do is annul the marriage. That
               will declare it invalid and officially cancel the whole deal.[0m
[36m         LONG  Annul, which means “to cancel” or “to invalidate,” is usually used in the context of politics or marriage. New government officials often want to annul laws
               and policies of the previous post-holder, effectively reversing their work. When you annul a marriage, you are officially declaring it invalid,
               as if it never happened. In the case of the unfortunate celebrity marriage, however, it could be difficult to completely erase all record of
               the event — especially if the tabloids hear about it.[0m
