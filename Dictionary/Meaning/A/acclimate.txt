[91m        SHORT  When you acclimate yourself to a situation, you become used to it. It usually means getting accustomed to a particular new climate, but it can also mean
               getting used to other situations, such as a new school.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word climate in the word acclimate should give you a clue as to the word's meaning: to get used to a specific climate. Nature allows the human body to
               acclimate itself to various weather conditions. For example, people moving to higher altitudes will develop more red blood cells in order to
               absorb oxygen better. This is their bodies' way of acclimating to the thinner air. It takes a while for the body to become acclimated to a new
               climate.[0m
