[91m        SHORT  You know you're driving through an affluent neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use affluent to describe wealthy
               people or areas.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Middle English, affluent meant "abundant, flowing," from Old French, from Latin affluƒìns, from affluere "to abound in," from the prefix ad- "to, at" plus
               fluere "to flow." The meaning of "abundant, flowing" is still seen in phrases such as "affluent prose." But mostly, when you use the word
               affluent, the thing understood to be flowing is cash.[0m
