[36m         LONG  In architecture, an arch is an opening that is often found supporting the weight of a something above it — like a bridge or a wall. In downtown St. Louis, you
               can visit the Gateway Arch — a freestanding catenary arch that is 630 feet tall and 630 feet wide. As a verb, arch means to make an arch-like
               shape. "She stretched her back by arching it into a backbend." As an adjective, arch can describe something mischievous or sly: "He teased his
               friend with an arch comment about his shyness around girls."[0m
