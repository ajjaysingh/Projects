[91m        SHORT  "A wise man once said..." Ever wonder who said that famous quotation? Then you're curious about its attribution. An attribution identifies a source or cause

[36m         LONG  Attribution often involves identifying the author or source of written material or a work of art. If you want to prove that painting you found in your
               basement is a van Gogh, you'd produce evidence to ensure proper attribution. The word can be used more generally to indicate the source of
               anything, whether it's a bombing, climate change, or success. For example, attribution of your success might be hard work and the support of
               family and friends.[0m
