[91m        SHORT  An abattoir is a slaughterhouse, or a place where animals are killed. It's not a word you're likely to hear or use unless you're involved in these activities.[0m
[36m         LONG  However, break abattoir into its component parts, abate + -ory, and things get a lot more interesting. -Ory is simple: it means "a place for," as in  factory,
               laboratory, and even auditorium. Abate is more complex. Today it means "to lessen," but back when it came to English via the Old French
               abattre, it meant "to beat down," a meaning Old French had inherited from the Latin ad ("to") + battere ("beat"). So when you think of
               abattoir, you can think of the idea of "a beating," or an animal's life "abating" until it is gone.[0m
