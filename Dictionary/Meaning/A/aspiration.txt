[91m        SHORT  If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest someday, you better start training, because it‚Äôs a long, hard climb that requires a lot of

[36m         LONG  Aspiration means "inhalation" or "breathing." So how did it come to mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue: spirare ("to
               breathe") and spiritus ("spirit"). It was once believed that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we talk about
               "breathing life into" something, or coming up with energy and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something than with
               ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?[0m
