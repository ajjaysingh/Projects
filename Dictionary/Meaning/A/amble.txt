[91m        SHORT  To amble is to take a leisurely, pleasurable walk. Care to amble down a pleasant country road instead of reading the rest of this word description? That would
               certainly be understandable.[0m
[36m         LONG  Amble is both a noun meaning "a stroll" and a verb meaning "to walk in a slow, leisurely way." You might amble (or take an amble) over to the snack table and
               grab a brownie. Amble comes from the Latin ambulare, which means "to walk about," as in ambulatory. Weirdly enough, it was once only used for
               horses or those on horseback. We use it for people now, but it still retains some of its horse-like, country feel.[0m
