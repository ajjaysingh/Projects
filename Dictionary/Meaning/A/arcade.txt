[91m        SHORT  An arcade is a structure made by enclosing a series of arches and columns. The word's roots go back to the Latin word "arcus," which means arc or bow.[0m
[36m         LONG  An arched, covered passageway with shops or stalls on the sides is also called an arcade and was a precursor to the shopping mall. The Burlington Arcade in
               London opened in 1819 and was the first shopping arcade of its kind in Britain. It still exists and is the longest covered shopping street in
               England. As more of these shopping arcades opened, they also began offering games and eventually the word's meaning came to include video
               arcades, where you can play coin-operated games.[0m
