[91m        SHORT  An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change ‚Äî like your
               antipathy for the Red Sox.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you look at the Greek roots of this word ‚Äî anti- (meaning "against") and pathos (meaning "feeling"), you can see that antipathy is a feeling against
               someone or something. In general, antipathies are considered feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out on the
               surface.[0m
