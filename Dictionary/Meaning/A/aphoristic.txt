	Wiki Definition:
              	An  aphorism  (from Greek ἀφορισμός: aphorismos, "delimitation", "distinction", " definition ") can be a terse saying, expressing a general truth or
               principle, or it can be an astute observation. An  aphorism  is spoken or written in a laconic and memorable form. The term was first used in
               the Aphorisms of Hippocrates.
