[91m        SHORT  This adjective is very bold — if you are audacious, you are daring and unconventional![0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective audacious comes from the Latin word audacia and means "daring, boldness, courage," and often gets applied in situations where someone does
               something pretty unusual, like becoming an astronaut and going to the moon. It can also mean challenging conventions and doing things that most
               people don't do, such as when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to become a doctor. Blackwell then inspired
               Elizabeth Garrett Anderson to become the first female doctor in England. And the rest is history![0m
