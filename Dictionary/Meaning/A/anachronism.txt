[36m         LONG  Anachronism comes from the Greek roots ana- which means "against" and chron- which means "time." Together they represent a situation in which something
               happens that should not because it belongs to another time period. You see anachronisms all the time in the movies ‚Äî they occur when you see a
               jet fly over a Civil War battle! Or knights jousting over a maiden during the time of Shakespeare![0m
