  SHORT        An altar is a raised area in a house of worship where people can honor God with offerings. It is prominent in the Bible as "God's table," a sacred place for
               sacrifices and gifts offered up to God.
  LONG         The word altar comes from the Latin altārium, meaning "high," and also to the Latin adolere, which means "to ritually burn or sacrifice," which suggests its
               early purpose as detailed in the Bible. Nowadays, the altar is the place for non-sacrificial religious rites such as communion or weddings, and
               is a metaphor for offerings. Comedian Stephen Fry once said, “I am a lover of truth, a worshipper of freedom, a celebrant at the altar of
               language and purity and tolerance.”

     >         A former altar boy educated by Jesuits, Mr. Castro reinstated Christmas as an official holiday when Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in 1998.
     >         The altar riddled with bullets, a priest's tomb ripped open.
     >         Chapter 1, “Becoming the Alchemist,” gives instructions for making a kitchen altar.
     >         Pictures around the altar have been torn down and the building ransacked.
     >         “Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah,” comes the confident chorus, as choir members stand and stomp at the altar of the white-steepled Lone Star Missionary Baptist Church in West
               Dallas.
