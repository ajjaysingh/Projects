                                                                                    AFFLUENCE                                                                                     
  SHORT        Affluence means great wealth and abundance, such as the great riches found by ancient explorers who exploited the new worlds of North and South America.
  LONG         The roots of the word affluence are recognizable in the Latin affluentia, which refers to something that flows toward (someone). We can see the connection
               when we think of the flow of wealth that signifies affluence in our society. For centuries we have seen the affluence in the United States that
               sparked admiration and jealousy among poorer nations, and we have seen that same affluence rising now in China, as it prepares to take its
               place as a major world power.

     >         With affluence comes accumulation, but also the urge to shed what has become more burden than blessing.
     >         China’s growing affluence means that TCM is undergoing a legitimate renaissance, buoyed by government sponsorship as Beijing seeks to boost its global soft
               power.
     >         “Because a country like Canada should not have people dying on our streets, homeless, when there is so much affluence and openness to global capital.”
     >         One classic example of affluence and power wrapped into a shoe is the high heel.
     >         This diverse force feels betrayed by trade and tax policies that create immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers.
