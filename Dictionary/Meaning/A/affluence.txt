[91m        SHORT  Affluence means great wealth and abundance, such as the great riches found by ancient explorers who exploited the new worlds of North and South America.[0m
[36m         LONG  The roots of the word affluence are recognizable in the Latin affluentia, which refers to something that flows toward (someone). We can see the connection
               when we think of the flow of wealth that signifies affluence in our society. For centuries we have seen the affluence in the United States that
               sparked admiration and jealousy among poorer nations, and we have seen that same affluence rising now in China, as it prepares to take its
               place as a major world power.[0m
