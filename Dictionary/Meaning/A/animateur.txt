[91m        SHORT  If you're an animator, you're an artist who makes a drawing, clay figure, or digital image appear to move. Animators draw the images that make your favorite
               cartoon character seem to walk and talk.[0m
[36m         LONG  It used to be that an animator drew a series of images on paper that would appear as continuous movement when they were viewed in quick succession. Now there
               are many different kinds of animation, including claymation, in which clay figures are repeatedly filmed, adjusted, and filmed again, seeming
               to move independently thanks to animators. The Latin root word is animare, "give breath to," from anima, "life."[0m
