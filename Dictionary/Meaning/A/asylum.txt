[91m        SHORT  When someone needs a refuge from a difficult or dangerous situation, they need asylum. If a government offers to protect people who have fled war or hardship
               in their own country, it gives them asylum.[0m

               and willingly go? An asylum offers shelter and protection, like the awning of a building in a downpour. Or it could be a country that takes in
               refugees in danger of persecution ‚Äî otherwise known as "political asylum."[0m
