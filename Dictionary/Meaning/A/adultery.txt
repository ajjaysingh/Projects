[91m        SHORT  Adultery is a word for cheating ‚Äî cheating on your spouse with another person. Adultery isn‚Äôt a crime, but some people consider it a sin.[0m
[36m         LONG  If two people are dating, and one fools around with someone else, it's not adultery. Only married people can commit adultery. If you commit adultery ‚Äî and
               your spouse finds out ‚Äî then you‚Äôve got a lot of explaining to do. Although it's still highly frowned upon, cultural attitudes toward adultery
               have changed a lot: the classic book The Scarlet Letter shows how harshly women were once treated for committing adultery.[0m
