[91m        SHORT  Every second grader knows how to pledge allegiance to the flag, but do you think they realize when they place their right hand over their hearts that they're

               firmest sense of the word. The liege in allegiance comes from the Old French word meaning "lord and master," which is who you would have been
               swearing your allegiance to if you'd been a servant in France centuries ago.[0m
