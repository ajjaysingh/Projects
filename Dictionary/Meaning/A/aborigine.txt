[91m        SHORT  If you’re an aborigine in a country, that means you were there first. Use the word to refer to someone or something that has been there since the beginning.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word aborigine traces back to the Latin ab origine, meaning "from the beginning," and as you might guess, this noun refers to something that has been
               there from the start. Aborigine is most often used to refer to a native group that has a longstanding historic or cultural tie to an area or
               country, unlike other groups that may have entered later to colonize the region. If the word is capitalized, it refers to someone belonging to
               the group of people that first inhabited Australia.[0m
