[91m        SHORT  The word alight has two distinct meanings: it can mean coming down or settling in a delicate manner, such as a bird perching, or it can be a rather poetic way
               to describe something that’s on fire (or “afire”).[0m
[36m         LONG  Just as the word alight has two distinct grammatical forms and meanings, it has two distinct beginnings in the Old English. That period’s word ālīhtan had an
               original meaning of dismounting, or lightening the load on the horse, and so is the ancestor of the verb we use today that means "to settle or
               perch."  Meanwhile, the word onlīhtan (see the different spelling?) of that same time meant to be on fire, which became our adjectival use of
               the word.[0m
