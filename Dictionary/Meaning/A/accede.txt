                                                                                      ACCEDE                                                                                      
  SHORT        If you accede, it means you agree with someone or give in to his or her wish.  The word is often used in a political context — the Queen acceded to the
               Prince's demands for more territory, a larger army, and funnier jesters.
  LONG         Accede can also be used for everyday situations.  If you accede to your mother's request that you come home before ten, it means you'll be missing that
               midnight movie with your friends.   Accede comes from the Latin accedere, meaning to "approach or enter upon."  It differs slightly from
               concede, which also means consent, but a more reluctant kind. If you were to concede to your mom's 10 PM curfew rather than accede to it, you'd
               be doing so against your will.

     >         Outside groups are calling on the incoming Trump administration to change that approach and to accede to more transparency rather than fighting it.
     >         Miller said that while such postings are psychological warfare intended to spread a message of fear, “We never accede to that.”
     >         To sideline their interests is to accede to a backlash that has just begun and will only get worse.
     >         To work with others, we may first need to acknowledge them – and learning about other perspectives is not the same as acceding to them.
     >         He was insistent that the leader accede to the plan, or quit: MS-13 would tolerate no dissidents.
