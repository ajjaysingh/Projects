[36m         LONG  Aghast comes from Old English gasten, "frighten," which comes in turn from gƒÅst, "ghost." If you've seen a look of absolute shock or terror on someone's face

      Origin:  late Middle English: past participle of the obsolete verb agast, gast ‚Äòfrighten‚Äô, from Old English g«£sten . The spelling with gh (originally Scots) became
               general by about 1700, probably influenced by ghost; compare with ghastly.
