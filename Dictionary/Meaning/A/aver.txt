[91m        SHORT  To aver is to declare something is true or to state. This verb has a serious tone, so you might aver something on a witness stand or you might aver that you
               won't back down to a challenge.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb aver comes to English via the Latin root words ad, meaning "to," and verus, meaning "true." The word can have the sense of formally declaring
               something is true, but it can also mean to report positively: "The grandmother averred that her granddaughter would make a fine veterinarian
               because of her love and caring for animals."[0m
