[36m         LONG  You can use the adverb abominably to describe anything that's done badly, whether it's truly hateful or simply careless. If a football team loses 0-72, it

               which comes from the the Late Latin abominabilis, "deserving abhorrence." It used to be mistakenly spelled "abhominable" from a belief that its
               origin included the Latin homine, or "human."[0m
