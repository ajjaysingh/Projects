[36m         LONG  The history of the word abrasive illustrates how a word typically enters the English language and then changes with time.  The English verb abrade "to wear
               down by scraping" entered the language from Latin abradere "to scrape off" in the late 1600s. Some 200 years later, the adjective form of the
               word ‚Äî abrasive ‚Äî came into use to describe a type of grinding tool. By the 1920s, abrasive had acquired the more figurative sense of annoying
               and infuriating. If you find someone abrasive, he or she grinds away at your nerves.[0m
