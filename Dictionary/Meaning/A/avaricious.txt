[91m        SHORT  Someone who is avaricious is greedy or grasping, concerned with gaining wealth. The suggestion is that an avaricious person will do anything to achieve
               material gain, and it is, in general, not a pleasant attribute.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin verb avƒìre, meaning "to crave" provides the groundwork for the word avaricious and its definition as "greedy or covetous." The adjective is applied
               to anyone who "craves" great wealth, and suggests that desire for personal gain is an overriding influence in the avaricious person's life. The
               widespread quality of this selfishness was cleverly noted by Voltaire, who wrote, ‚ÄúMen hate the individual whom they call avaricious only
               because nothing can be gained from him.‚Äù[0m
