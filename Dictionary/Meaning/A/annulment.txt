[91m        SHORT  An annulment is the cancellation of revocation of something, like a marriage. After an annulment, it's like the marriage never happened.[0m
[36m         LONG  The root nul  (from Latin nullum) of this word is a good clue to its meaning: the underlying verb annul originally meant "reduce to nothing." An annulment
               also reduces something to nothing by canceling or terminating it, usually in a legal sense. The most common use of the term is the annulment of
               a marriage, which not only ends the marriage, but legally makes it as if the marriage never happened. Annulment is like a legal eraser.[0m
