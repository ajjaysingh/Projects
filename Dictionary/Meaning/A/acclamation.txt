[91m        SHORT  Acclamation is acclaim or recognition for some achievement. A major league baseball team might have to win the World Series to get acclamation, but a t-ball

[36m         LONG  The acclamation you get on opening night might be your main incentive for acting in plays. Likewise, the acclamation they receive while campaigning is
               probably more attractive to some politicians than the actual work of governing. Acclamation can sometimes take the form of enthusiastic
               shouting, and in fact the Latin root acclamationem means "a shout of approval."[0m
