[36m         LONG  Someone who favors anarchism can be described as an anarchist, a person who places the most political importance on individual freedom, especially from
               powerful governments. Anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes hierarchies ‚Äî systems in which one powerful person is in charge ‚Äî and
