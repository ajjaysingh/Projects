[91m        SHORT  If you call an ad hoc meeting of your knitting buddies, it means the meeting was formed for one particular reason ‚Äî to knit. Anything ad hoc is either done
               for one specific purpose, or in an impromptu, last-minute way.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ad hoc comes from the Latin words meaning "for this." Often the term is used as a criticism, in the sense that something done ad hoc is done hastily and can
               be ill thought out, serving only to address a problem in the short term. Government programs are often described as ad hoc, for example. But
               the term can also imply a sense of ingenuity, of impromptu brilliance, or of something happily care-free and devoid of fuss. Like your ad hoc
               knitting event![0m
