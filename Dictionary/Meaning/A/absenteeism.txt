[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôve got no reason to skip school or work but you do it all the time anyway, you‚Äôve go a bad case of absenteeism. When there's absenteeism, someone isn't

[36m         LONG  Absenteeism is a word for the habit of being absent. If you miss weeks of school, absenteeism has become a problem. Calling in sick to work every week is
               another example of absenteeism. Absenteeism can be like a contagious disease ‚Äî sometimes entire schools have problems with absenteeism. If
               there‚Äôs a good excuse for the absence, like a serious illness, it‚Äôs not absenteeism. So don‚Äôt forget those doctor‚Äôs notes.[0m
