[36m         LONG  Astute (from Latin) is a formal and flattering adjective for someone with a good head on their shoulders. It differs from its synonym shrewd in placing less
               emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity: we talk about a shrewd bargainer but an astute interpretation. Other synonyms are perceptive
               (emphasizing insight) and discerning (emphasizing an ability to distinguish).[0m
