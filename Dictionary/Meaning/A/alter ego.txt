                                               ALTER EGO                                               
  SHORT        Your alter ego is a person to whom you are so close that he almost seems like an
               essential part of you, and who understands your unique perspective
               on the world.
  LONG         You can use the noun alter ego to describe your very best friend, the person who
               knows you better than anyone else. The Latin meaning of alter ego is
               "other self," and it was used by the ancient Roman statesman and
               philosopher Cicero in a letter to his friend and adviser, Atticus:
               "You are a second brother to me, an alter ego to whom I can tell
               everything."
