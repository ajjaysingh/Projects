[36m         LONG  The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis "light" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate ‚Äî both words implying a
               lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine
               to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world
               hunger.[0m
