[91m        SHORT  Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently somebody was hungry!"[0m
[36m         LONG  While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not quite. There's a certain
               amount of guessing involved, based on appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine the path of destruction through your
               campsite might say that it was "apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure, but because it definitely looks like
               something the bears around here would do.[0m
