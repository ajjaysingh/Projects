[91m        SHORT  An annuity is money that comes from an investment and is paid out regularly over a fixed period of time. You can buy an insurance policy that is an annuity,
               or you can choose an annuity as one of your retirement fund options.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun annuity is from the Latin word annus, meaning "year." Indeed, annuities typically pay out on a year basis, although other terms are possible. If you
               win a large amount of money in the lottery, you can usually choose to take a lump-sum payment or smaller payments paid every year over some
               term, like 20 or 25 years. Figuring out which payment plan is best for you would be a nice problem to have![0m
