[91m        SHORT  An accordion is a hand-held musical instrument that has a keyboard or buttons and a bellows that blows air in and out. A street musician might play folk tunes
               on her accordion and collect donations in a hat.[0m
[36m         LONG  One of the distinct features of an accordion is its bellows, which looks like a series of pleats at the center of the instrument, and which allows the player
               to push and pull the accordion as she plays, blowing air across reeds inside it. The accordion was invented in the early 1800s, and it's played
               in many countries around the world. The word comes from the German Akkordion, from Akkord, "musical chord" or "be in tune."[0m
