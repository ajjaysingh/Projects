[91m        SHORT  An abrasion is a scrape. An abrasion can happen to a person, as in a skinned knee, or to an object, as in what you get when you apply sandpaper to wood.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun abrasion comes to us from the Latin abradere, which means ‚Äúscrape away‚Äù or ‚Äúshave off.‚Äù Any area that shows evidence of scratching or scraping can be
               called an abrasion, like that spot on the front bumper of your car from when you cut it too close pulling into the gas station. Abrasion can
               also mean the process of friction causing scratches, as in: "the abrasion of everyone sliding chairs on the floor left terrible marks."[0m
