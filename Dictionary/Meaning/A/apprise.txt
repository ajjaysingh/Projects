[91m        SHORT  To apprise someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be
               the first one to be apprised of that event![0m
[36m         LONG  Don't confuse the verbs apprise and appraise. Appraise means to determine the value of something ‚Äî either its quality or its monetary worth. Apprise, on the
               other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you
               will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans.[0m
