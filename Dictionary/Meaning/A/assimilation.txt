[91m        SHORT  Whether you’re talking about ideas or nutrients, assimilation describes the act of taking something in and absorbing it fully.[0m
[36m         LONG  Assimilation comes from the Latin assimilationem, meaning “likeness" or "similarity.” People of different backgrounds and beliefs undergo assimilation when,
               through living together, they come to see themselves as part of a larger community, or when a small group is absorbed into, and made part of, a
               bigger group, such as the Irish immigrants in America in the 19th century. Assimilation can also refer to the absorption of new ideas into
               existing knowledge.[0m
