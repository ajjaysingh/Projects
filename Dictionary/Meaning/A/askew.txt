[36m         LONG  The movie ‚ÄúLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events‚Äù tells the story of three orphans and their struggle to escape their wicked guardian, Count Olaf.
               In the story, the orphans are sent to stay with their Aunt Josephine, whose house sits perilously on the edge of cliff over a leech-infested
               lake. The floor of Josephine‚Äôs house is at an angle, pictures hang off-center, and in fact everything appears to be tilted and wildly askew,
               including their aunt‚Äôs mental condition.[0m
