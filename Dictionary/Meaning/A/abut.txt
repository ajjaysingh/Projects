[91m        SHORT  When something borders something else, it is said to abut it. The term is often used in real estate to refer to a lot line. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have your
               back yard abut a forest preserve or park?[0m
[36m         LONG  The Old French word but meant "end" ‚Äî think of "butt" for a crude way to remember that! ‚Äî and it was joined to a-, from the Latin ad- "near to." The result
               was abuter, which meant "to touch at an end." The word eventually became abouter, meaning "to join at the ends, or border on." The idea of abut
               suggesting a common boundary comes from the late Middle English, and today we use the word when anything touches something else.[0m
