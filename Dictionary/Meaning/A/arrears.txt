[91m        SHORT  If you are in arrears, you are behind in the payment of a debt. Think: rears=behind. Arrears also refers to the unpaid, overdue debt itself. Your rent arrears
               are the  money you own on rent.[0m
[36m         LONG  Arrears is a term often used in a legal contextâ€“â€“like, when you've had to hire a lawyer because you're being sued by your landlord, or being evicted because
               you're in arrears on your rent. Before it comes to eviction, though, you should try negotiating with your landlord first. They would probably
               be more interested in collecting arrears, even late, than in evicting you and starting with a new tenant from scratch.[0m
