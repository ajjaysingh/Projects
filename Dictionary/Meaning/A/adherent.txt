[91m        SHORT  Because an adherent is usually something or someone that sticks to something or someone else, it's logical that it can also mean a person who believes in and
               supports a certain philosophy or leader.[0m
[36m         LONG  An adherent to a cause can be called a disciple, one who believes and tries to get others to believe. It can also refer to a material that sticks to other
               things.  While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases,
               the word comes from the Latin root haerƒìre "stick," connected to the prefix ad- "to," making the word mean "to stick to."[0m
