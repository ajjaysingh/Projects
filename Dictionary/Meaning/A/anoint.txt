  LONG         Saints and religious leaders are said to be anointed, but so is that new unstoppable quarterback who saved the team midseason. Anoint comes to us from the
               ancient Latin word unguere, which means "to smear." Which explains the other sense of this word, which is to apply with oil or another
               smearable substance, such as during a religious ceremony.

     >         "The level of anointing is not the same. If you cannot turn water into wine, do not try this at home."
     >         Prime Minister Sharif has now anointed six army chiefs of staff during his years in power.
     >         When Tesfaye anointed himself King of the Fall, it was a reference to an autumn tour, not to Spengler’s Decline and Fall of the West.
     >         For more than a decade, he has been the Republican Party’s anointed ideas man for hard-line immigration policies.
     >         Writers anointed him the rightful heir to Jackson, Dempsey, Louis and Ali, but D'Amato's fighting machine was already malfunctioning.
