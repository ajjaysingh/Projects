[36m         LONG  Appropriation originally referred to the taking of private property, usually by the government. Nowadays, appropriation can be positive or negative, but

               appropriation of new technology to improve their product. Appropriation can also refer to the setting aside of funds by the government for a
               specific purpose, like for improving school systems or supporting the arts.[0m
