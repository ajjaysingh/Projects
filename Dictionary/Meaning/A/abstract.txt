[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective abstract for something that is not a material object or is general and not based on specific examples.[0m
[36m         LONG  Abstract is from a Latin word meaning "pulled away, detached," and the basic idea is of something detached from physical, or concrete, reality. It is
               frequently used of ideas, meaning that they don't have a clear applicability to real life, and of art, meaning that it doesn't pictorially
               represent reality. It is also used as a noun, especially in the phrase "in the abstract" (a joke has a person laying down a new sidewalk saying
               "I like little boys in the abstract, but not in the concrete"), and as a verb (accented on the second syllable), meaning "to remove."[0m
