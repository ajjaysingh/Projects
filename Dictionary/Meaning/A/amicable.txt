[91m        SHORT  The adjective amicable means "friendly" ‚Äî but in particular, use it when describing relations one might otherwise expect to be unfriendly. The end of a
               romantic relationship that's less than amicable might involve broken dishes or broken bones.[0m
[36m         LONG  Amicable, not surprisingly, comes from the Latin word for "friend," amicus. Perhaps the things most commonly described as amicable are divorces. The parties
               in a divorce often tend to be so childish and the proceedings so messy that it's nice to have a word that reflects the absence of those
               qualities. Other nouns that commonly pair with amicable include relationship, split, parting, solution, and breakup.[0m
