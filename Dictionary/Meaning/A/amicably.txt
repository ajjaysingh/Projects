[91m        SHORT  When you do something amicably, you're doing it politely and nicely. It's best to deal with traffic cops and waiters amicably.[0m

               there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming, and they both agreed to it. You could say two countries that dislike each other had a meeting of
               their leaders that was conducted amicably: they were polite and said nice things, even though that's not necessarily how they felt.[0m
