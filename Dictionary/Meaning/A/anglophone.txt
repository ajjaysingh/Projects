[91m        SHORT  An anglophobe is someone who deeply dislikes England or English people. If your friend refuses to buy a plane ticket to India because the flight stops in
               London on the way, it might be because she's an anglophobe.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you distrust someone purely because of his British accent, you're an anglophobe, and if you refuse to buy products made in England just because you hate
               the country, you're also an anglophobe. A British politician might accuse a Scot who favors independence from the UK of being an anglophobe.
               The word has two roots, the Latin angli, "the English," and the Greek phobia, or "a panicked fear of."[0m
