[91m        SHORT  Locked in a mean-spirited, bitter argument? That's an acrimonious situation that might result in fists flying unless you and your opponent can cool down.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you're familiar with the adjective acrid, which means "having a strongly unpleasant taste or smell," you might guess that acrimonious probably refers to
               something unpleasant, too. And you'd be right. Until the mid-nineteenth century, acrimonious meant the same thing as acrid. But while acrid is
               still most commonly used in a literal sense (as in "an acrid odor"), acrimonious is now used to describe things like angry and bitter speeches
               or debates. Both words come to English from the Latin word  acer, meaning "sharp." Keep sharp objects locked up if a showdown gets too
               acrimonious.[0m
