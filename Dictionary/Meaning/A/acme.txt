[91m        SHORT  When something is at the very peak of perfection, reach for this noun from Greek: acme. A brilliant violinist might reach the acme of her career, but
               eventually she might become unstrung.[0m
[36m         LONG  This noun referring to the highest point of something might sound comical because it has shown up so often in cartoons as the name of a company, such as the
               one that makes Wile E. Coyote's contraptions in the old Warner Brothers cartoons. But the word is actually a serious-minded import from Greek.
               Near synonyms for high points include zenith, summit, pinnacle, apex, and peak, but acme has a special nuance for an ultimate point of
               perfection.[0m
