  SHORT        Something anecdotal has to do with anecdotes — little stories. Anecdotal evidence is based on hearsay rather than hard facts.
  LONG         People like to share stories about things that happened to them, or that they heard about, to make a point. That kind of talk is anecdotal: based on small,
               personal accounts. Anecdotal stories are helpful when you’re trying to give an example of something, but there's a downside to anecdotal
               information: since it’s not based on facts, you never know if you can totally trust it. So it's best to go beyond the anecdotal and get more
               solid information.
