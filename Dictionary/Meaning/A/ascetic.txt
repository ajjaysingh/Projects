[91m        SHORT  Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-

[36m         LONG  Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning ‚Äúmonk,‚Äù or ‚Äúhermit.‚Äù Later that became asketikos, meaning ‚Äúrigorously self-disciplined,‚Äù which gives us the
               Modern English ascetic. Ascetic can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the ability to deprive herself, or an adjective
               that describes such a people or their lifestyle.[0m
