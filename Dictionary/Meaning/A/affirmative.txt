[91m        SHORT  Something affirmative expresses agreement or approval, like the affirmative nod your mother gives you when you ask to be excused from the dinner table. A
               formal way of saying "Yes" is "Affirmative!"[0m
[36m         LONG  Anything affirmative is approving of something: affirmative words support someone or something. Being affirmative is the opposite of being negative or
               contradicting. A pat on the back is affirmative so is a signature you need to complete a form. Also, you can use affirmative as a formal way of
               saying yes to something. This is common in the military. It might sound a little odd, but if your teacher asked, "Does 10 plus 10 equal 20?"
               you could answer, "Affirmative!"[0m
