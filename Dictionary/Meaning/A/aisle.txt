[91m        SHORT  An aisle is a passageway, often between seating areas or shelves. Brides walk down aisles in between church pews, while you might head to the cookie aisle in
               the supermarket.[0m
[36m         LONG  An aisle is essentially a passageway between something. You have to walk down an aisle to reach your seat at a theater or concert hall, to get to your seat on
               a crowded airplane, or to reach the produce at your local supermarket. The ai in aisle is pronounced like a long i, so the word sounds like
               isle rather than ail.[0m
