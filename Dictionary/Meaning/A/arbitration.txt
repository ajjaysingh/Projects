[91m        SHORT  When an uninvolved, impartial person is called in to help settle a dispute, it's called arbitration. The person in charge of the arbitration acts like an
               official referee, helping both sides come to an agreement.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun arbitration comes to English via the Latin word arbitrari, meaning "to judge." In English, arbitration is both the process of using an arbiter to
               settle a dispute and the act of that arbiter making a judgment. Many parents know that if the arbitration of your kids' argument was deemed
               unfair by both kids, you've usually made the right decision.[0m
