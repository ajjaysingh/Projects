[91m        SHORT  Use the word alpine to describe something that reminds you of high mountains. You could describe the distant clouds in the sky over the plains as "vaguely
               alpine."[0m
[36m         LONG  A plant or animal that lives in the mountains is alpine, and your summer trip hiking in the Rocky Mountains is also alpine. The kind of skiing that requires a
               mountain to race down is alpine skiing, and moss that grows at very high altitudes is alpine moss. In fact, if something has to do with tall
               mountains, it's alpine. The word means "of the Alps," and if Alpine is capitalized, it is referring specifically to the Alps.[0m
