[91m        SHORT  Ale is a particular type of beer. Ale would be a good thing to order if you ever visit a pub in Britain.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ale is yeast-fermented beer, brewed with sweet-tasting malted barley, and often with hops, to balance the sweetness with a more bitter flavor. In Britain, ale
               is considered to be any beer "other than lager, stout, or porter," while in the US ale is distinguished by the style of fermentation. The Old
               English origin of ale is ealu, "ale or beer." The Proto-Indo-European root has an implied meaning of "sorcery, magic, and intoxication."[0m
