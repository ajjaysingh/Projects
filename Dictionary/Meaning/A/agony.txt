[91m        SHORT  The noun agony means acute pain ‚Äî either mental or physical, but people often use the word hyperbolically: "This paper cut is agony."[0m

               pain, but the physical pain, was nothing compared to his mental agony when the doctor setting the bone joked, 'Now you know the agony of de
               feet!'"[0m
