                                              ALTERCATION                                              
  SHORT        Altercation is a nicer word for "quarrel," which is a nicer word for "fight."
  LONG         Fight is a simple, effective one-syllable word, while quarrel is a softer, two-
               syllable word, and altercation is a very civilized-sounding four-
               syllable word for the same uncivilized thing: a noisy argument
               between people that are mad at each other. Two cowboys fighting in a
               saloon probably won’t talk about their altercation, but someone who
               gets a black eye fighting for a parking spot might — after cooling
               down — describe the incident as an altercation rather than as a
               knock-down, drag-out brawl.
