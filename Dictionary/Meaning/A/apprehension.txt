[91m        SHORT  Apprehension is fear or anxiety about something – you might feel apprehension about an upcoming test. Apprehension is also the capture of a criminal, when
               they get apprehended, or caught. It can mean “understand an idea” too.  Get it?[0m
[36m         LONG  Given the crook's record of evading arrest, the chief had real apprehensions about being able to catch him. Eventually though, she activated the whole police
               force in an effort to ensure the crook's apprehension. And it paid off! They caught him red-handed. But it wasn't until he saw the video of the
               crime in progress that the guy apprehended just how much trouble he was in. It was that apprehension that led him to make a deal with the
               district attorney.[0m
