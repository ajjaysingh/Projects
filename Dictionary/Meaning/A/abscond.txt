[91m        SHORT  Abscond is to escape, often taking something along. As a kid, you may have absconded from your lemonade stand — with the coffee can of cash in hand, and your
               bewildered sister still filling cups for your customers.[0m
[36m         LONG  Abscond is generally used to describe someone running from law or capture, and the word abscond has been in use since the early sixteenth century — running
               away and hiding being nothing new. Dogs who get off the leash and dart into the woods are not necessarily absconding; they are simply making a
               break for it. On the other hand, the Ponzi schemer who went to live in the South of France with his client's money? He absconded.[0m
