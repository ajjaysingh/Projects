[91m        SHORT  Although abash sounds like a big party or what firefighters do to get through a locked door, abash is, in fact, a verb that means you have caused another
               person to feel awkward, bashful, embarrassed, or ashamed.[0m
[36m         LONG  To make your best friend feel abashed, you might tell her new boyfriend about the time she... but why would you want to embarrass her? Typically abash is used
               when something has a shaming effect. You might find yourself saying: ‚ÄúI was abashed by the magnitude of the others‚Äô generosity so I donated
               twenty thousand more,‚Äù but you wouldn‚Äôt just use abash in place of embarrass. It would sound strange to warn, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre going to
               abash yourself!‚Äù[0m
