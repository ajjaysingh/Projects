[91m        SHORT  Acrimony is bitterness, or ill will. Acrimony is a spiteful word. It sounds bitter, like acid.[0m
[36m         LONG  Acrimony comes from the Latin word acrimonia, meaning basically "sharpness." Although it sounds like matrimony, the only thing the words have in common is the
               suffix from monium which means "state, condition." So it's the state of being acrid, or bitter. It's not just for married folks, though ‚Äî this
               slightly dusty noun can refer to any sharp, bitter feeling. After a drawn-out court case, there might be lingering acrimony stirred up during
               the trial. Not surprisingly, it's also the name of a British heavy metal band from the '90s.[0m
