  SHORT        Albedo refers to how reflective and bright something is. Snow has a high albedo, which is why skiers wear sunglasses and sunscreen.
  LONG         Technically speaking, the albedo of an object is a ratio. It compares the amount of light hitting the surface of the object to the amount of light that gets
               reflected back. The more light reflected, the higher the albedo. Scientists often use this word in reference to the surfaces of planets and
               other reflective objects in the night sky. Albedo comes from a Latin word for “white.”
