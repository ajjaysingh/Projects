                                               ARBITRARY                                               
  SHORT        Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a
               consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a
               totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.
  LONG         Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning "judge" (arbiter), that doesn't
               mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker arbitrary is
               usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules
               based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting
               players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be
               picking names out of a hat.

               arbitrary.
