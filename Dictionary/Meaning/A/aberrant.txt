[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.[0m
[36m         LONG  For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put
               the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare
               means "to go astray," from the prefix ab- "off, away" plus errare "to wander."  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant,
               have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected.[0m
