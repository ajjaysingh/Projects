[91m        SHORT  If you find yourself making eyes at that stranger across the coffee shop, chances are there is an allure about him or her ‚Äî something mysteriously, powerfully
               attractive and tempting.[0m

               the hook. First used in the 15th century, this word has even landed its own fashion magazine ‚Äî "Allure," which tries to tempt people to buy it
               by putting powerfully attractive people on the cover and hoping you'll believe that if you buy it, you'll have some allure as well.[0m
