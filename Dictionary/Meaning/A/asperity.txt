[91m        SHORT  Asperity is the harsh tone or behavior people exhibit when they‚Äôre angry, impatient, or just miserable. When your supervisor‚Äôs ‚ÄúLate again!‚Äù greeting causes
               your entire future to pass before your eyes, he is speaking with asperity.[0m
[36m         LONG  The harshness that asperity implies can also apply to conditions, like "the asperities of life in a bomb shelter." Or even more literally to surfaces, like
               "the asperity of an unfinished edge." But, most often, you will see asperity used in reference to grumpy human beings.[0m
