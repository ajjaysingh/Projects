[91m        SHORT  An avenue is a street, especially a wide one lined with trees. An avenue is also any approach to doing something. For example, this web site might be a new
               avenue you have found for learning words.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word avenue comes from the French avenir, meaning "to come to, or arrive." The first meaning is simply a wide street. An avenue ‚Äî or boulevard ‚Äî is likely
               to be busy, unlike a quiet side street. The abbreviation is ave., as in Park Ave. Also, an avenue is a way to accomplish something. If you need
               money but can't get a loan, you'll have to find another avenue.[0m
