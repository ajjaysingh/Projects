[91m        SHORT  That tattoo on your lower back is likely to appall your mother. Just like her pink hair once appalled your grandmother. To appall is to shock and disgust.[0m
[36m         LONG  Appall comes from an Old French word meaning "to make pale." If a gory scene in a movie appalls you, you're likely to turn pale. The word appall always
               carries with it the feeling of disgust. You might be shocked by a loud noise, but in order for it to appall you, it would probably have to come
               along with a really foul smell or a gruesome scene.[0m
