[91m        SHORT  Annals are chronological historical records. Some annals recount the achievements of war heroes; others, in the form of high school yearbooks, record
               historically terrible hairstyles.[0m
[36m         LONG  Annals comes from the Latin word annus, meaning year. As the word itself suggests, many annals are yearly records, but this is not always the case. You may
               encounter the word annals in the phrase ‚Äúannals of history,‚Äù which refers not to one specific historical record but the collection of all
               recorded history. Scholarly societies often refer to their regular reports as annals, as in the Annals of the International Society for
               Porcupine Studies.[0m
