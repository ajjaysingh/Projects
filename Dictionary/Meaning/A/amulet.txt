[91m        SHORT  If you rub your pendant while praying to your gods, it sounds like you have an amulet, a necklace or similar item attributed with magical powers.[0m
[36m         LONG  An amulet is something that wards off evil spells and all manner of bad luck. Often found in undeveloped societies — or Brady Bunch episodes — an amulet acts
               as a charm to protect its wearer from evil. Often worn close to the heart as a necklace, the word amulet can refer to any a piece of jewelry or
               other trinket that is kept close to the body and believed to keep evil and danger at bay.[0m
