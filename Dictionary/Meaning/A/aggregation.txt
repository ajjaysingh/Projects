  SHORT        An aggregation is a collection, or the gathering of things together. Your baseball card collection might represent the aggregation of lots of different types
               of cards.
  LONG         Aggregation comes from the Latin ad, meaning to, and gregare, meaning herd. So the word was first used to literally mean to herd or to flock. Now it's just
               refers to anything herded together in a collection or assemblage. If you work in a lab, for example, you may be charged with the aggregation of
               samples prior to experimentation.
