[36m         LONG  Analogous things can be compared to each other, so a near synonym is the adjective comparable. Analogous is a term used in biology to refer to body parts that
               have a similar function but differ in structure, such as the wings of a bird and the wings of an airplane. Analogous is from Latin analogus,
               from Greek analogos, meaning "according to a proper ratio or proportion."[0m
