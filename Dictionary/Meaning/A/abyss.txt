[91m        SHORT  The noun abyss refers to a deep void or chasm â€” either literal or figurative. Making a momentous life decision with great uncertainty, like enrolling in clown
               college, might feel like jumping into the abyss.[0m
[36m         LONG  Traditionally, the abyss referred to the "bottomless pit" of Hell. Now it might refer to either a literal chasm or a figurative one: "Thirty years ago, we
               peered into this abyss and pulled back just in time." The word is sometimes used to describe a wide difference between cultures or nations.
               Abyss comes from Greek: a- "without" + byssos, "depth, bottom." You may know the related adjective abysmal, which means "appallingly bad" â€” or
               "way down in the depths," as it were.[0m
