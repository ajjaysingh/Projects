[91m        SHORT  When you alienate people, you make them stop liking or caring about you. Show up at a conference of cat lovers with a sign around your neck that says, "I hate

[36m         LONG  Back in the days of Latin, before the word alien came to mean little green men from outer space, it described something or someone that was foreign or
               different or not known: an alien custom, an alien nation. When you alienate people, you make them WISH you were an alien, or at least that they
