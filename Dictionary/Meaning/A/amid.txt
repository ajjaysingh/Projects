     >         The backbone amide hydrogen bonds maintain the β-strands at a spacing of 4.8 Å in the direction of the fibril.
     >         It was Brown’s first official appearance since Gov. John Kitzhaber announced his resignation amide an ethics scandal, followed by news of a federal criminal
               investigation.
     >         His team had attached an amide group to the peptide hormones, mimicking a common modification made to the peptide when it is produced in cattle.
