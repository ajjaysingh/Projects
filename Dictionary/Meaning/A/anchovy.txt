[91m        SHORT  An anchovy is a very small, silvery fish. People who eat anchovies enjoy their strong, fishy flavor.[0m
[36m         LONG  While you can buy fresh anchovies from many fish markets, they're most commonly sold packed in small tins, covered in salt and oil. Fishermen often use
               anchovies as bait for larger fish as well. Even people who don't think they like anchovies are sometimes familiar with the taste, as they're
               used in Caesar salad dressing and Worcestershire sauce. Anchovy comes from the Portuguese anchova, possibly from the Latin apua, "small fish."[0m
