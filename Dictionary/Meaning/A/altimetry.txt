[91m        SHORT  An altimeter measures how far above ground something is. You wouldn't want to fly a plane without an altimeter![0m
[36m         LONG  The two halves of altimeter should give you a clue to its meaning: altitude is height above ground, and meters are used to measure distance. An altimeter
               measures altitude. This is an extremely important device in the field of aviation. When flying an airplane, pilots needs to know exactly what
               their altitude is: the altimeter tells them. Pilots flying helicopters, blimps, and other flying vehicles use altimeters too. A plane without a
               working altimeter isn't safe to fly.[0m
