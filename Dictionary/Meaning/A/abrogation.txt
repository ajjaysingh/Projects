[91m        SHORT  Abrogation is the act of canceling, nullifying, or repealing something, almost always in an official or legal context.[0m
[36m         LONG  To abrogate something is to repeal or cancel it, so abrogation is the act of repealing or canceling. This is mainly a legal term. Abrogation occurs whenever
               an old law or rule is abolished, like when slavery was outlawed. The abrogation of a lease means it is no longer valid and binding. The
               annulment of a marriage â€” which legally wipes out the marriage, as if it never happened â€” is also a type of abrogation.[0m
