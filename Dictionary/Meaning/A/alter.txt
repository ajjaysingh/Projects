                                                 ALTER                                                 
  SHORT        After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her uniform, so
               she had a seamstress alter it. It looked pretty much the same.
  LONG         The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that has just been
               spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat that you
               dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to
               reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat.
