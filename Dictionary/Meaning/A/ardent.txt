[36m         LONG  Ardent is most often used to modify words like supporter, fan, advocate, admirer, and defender — but also opponent. Although you can either ardently support
               or oppose something, support is by far the more common use. The word literally means "burning" or "glowing" — it's from Latin ardere, "to
               burn." In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean "glowing," as Alexander Pope did in his 1718 translation of Homer's Iliad: "From rank
               to rank she darts her ardent eyes."[0m
