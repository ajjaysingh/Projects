  SHORT        If you are ardent, you are passionate about something. A pop star's ardent admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.
  LONG         Ardent is most often used to modify words like supporter, fan, advocate, admirer, and defender — but also opponent. Although you can either ardently support
               or oppose something, support is by far the more common use. The word literally means "burning" or "glowing" — it's from Latin ardere, "to
               burn." In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean "glowing," as Alexander Pope did in his 1718 translation of Homer's Iliad: "From rank
               to rank she darts her ardent eyes."

     >         A significant number of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely.
     >         But not even his most ardent admirers would have had him down as a future leader of Her Majesty's opposition.
     >         Some of Trump’s shifts also have the potential to spark a backlash from his most ardent supporters.
