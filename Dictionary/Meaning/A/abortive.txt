[36m         LONG  Abortive is a variation of abort, which means to end something, so something abortive never reaches its end point. If you tried like crazy to run a marathon
               but couldn't finish, your efforts were abortive. If someone tripped you during the marathon, their efforts were abortive too. Abortive things
               always lead to the words "The end." Abortive can also be a way of avoiding the word unsuccessful.[0m
