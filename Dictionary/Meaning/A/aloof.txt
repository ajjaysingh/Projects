[91m        SHORT  Someone who's aloof isn't warm and friendly, instead being distant and reserved. That emotionally cold and detached fellow who keeps to himself, drinking
               espresso and reading French philosophy, would best be described as aloof.[0m
[36m         LONG  In Middle English, aloof was originally a nautical term; the loof (now spelled luff) is the windward side of a ship. Smart sailors wanting to avoid a hazard
               on the leeward side would give the order, "A loof!" From this command we get the idea of steering clear of something (or someone). In modern
               usage the word has taken on a negative connotation: an aloof person is often considered cold or snobby.[0m
