[91m        SHORT  To actuate is to put into motion. The "act" in actuate can remind you of this word's meaning ‚Äî to put into action. A lever might actuate a pump, or malice
               might actuate a crime.[0m
[36m         LONG  Coming to us from the Latin word actus, which means "to act," actuate's meaning is simpler than it sounds ‚Äî it just means to set in motion or activate some
               kind of motion. Think of one of those complex Rube Goldberg mouse traps; you know, the one where the boot kicks the ball that drops on the
               plank that tips over the ladder which rings a bell that cracks an egg that knocks over the cage onto the unsuspecting mouse. The boot actuates
               the whole shebang.[0m
