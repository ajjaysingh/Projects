[91m        SHORT  Something that seems full of life and movement is said to be animated. Animated films for television and movies include cartoons, Claymation, puppets, and
               computer-generated images, which are all simulations of living things.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin animƒÅre "give breath to" is the basis for the word animated. The business of animated films has grown with the advent of computers, but the idea of
               animating something began long before cartoons and CGI. In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel "Frankenstein," the monster, built of dead
               parts, is animated by electrical impulses, an idea that "sparked" a fascination with regeneration that survives to this very day.[0m
