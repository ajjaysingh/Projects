[91m        SHORT  To atone is to do something "right" to make up for doing something wrong. Religious believers are known to atone for their sins, but even students can atone
               for a past failure by acing a quiz or two.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word atone came to English as a contraction of the words at and one. The verb means to make amends or reparations for an offense or wrong doing. You can
               remember the meaning by thinking of it as a sort of Zen concept, to be "at one" or in harmony with someone, you have to atone for your mistakes
               and be forgiven. In a religious sense, it means to repent for sins ("to atone for his sins").[0m
