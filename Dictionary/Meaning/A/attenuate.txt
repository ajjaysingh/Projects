[91m        SHORT  Attenuate is a verb that means to make or become weaker. The effects of aging may be attenuated by exercise (or by drinking from the fountain of youth).[0m
[36m         LONG  The versatile word attenuate denotes a weakening in amount, intensity, or value. As a verb, attenuate is usually transitive, meaning it needs an object to be
               complete, such as in the sentence: "This tanning process tends to attenuate the deer hide, making it softer." The word can be intransitive in
               past tense, as in "The rain attenuated, ending the storm."  And it can even be used as an adjective to describe something weakened: "Even an
               attenuated solution will remove the stain."[0m
