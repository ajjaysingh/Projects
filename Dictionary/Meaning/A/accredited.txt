[91m        SHORT  When you're accredited in your profession, you've shown that you meet certain standards.  Schools and colleges are accredited by various educational
               organizations, dentists are accredited by the American Dental Association, and other professionals are accredited by their own organizations.[0m
[36m         LONG  The key to accredited is the word in the middle: credit. If you give someone credit, you praise them and recognize something they've done. Accredited is
               similar: If you‚Äôre a school or a doctor or another kind of professional, being accredited means you've been tested and evaluated by an outside
               person or committee and these specialists agree that you meet the standards of that profession. When people hire you, they can be assured that
               you know what you‚Äôre doing.[0m
