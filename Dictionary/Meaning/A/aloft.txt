[91m        SHORT  Something up in the air or really high is aloft. Aloft has a soft, floaty sound to it, and it's a great word for talking about flying birds, airborne ballet

               aloft when you hold them high to catch a Frisbee. Some things are stationary, or set in place, and aloft, like tree houses and birds' nests.
