  SHORT        If you use the adjective archaic you are referring to something outmoded, belonging to an earlier period. Rotary phones and cassette players already seem so
               archaic!
  LONG         The adjective archaic means something that belongs to an earlier or antiquated time. It can also mean something that is outdated but can still be found in the
               present and therefore could seem out of place. The word comes from archaic (i.e., ancient) Greek, archaikos, and literally means "from
               Classical Greek culture," though its meaning has broadened as it's been used in English.
