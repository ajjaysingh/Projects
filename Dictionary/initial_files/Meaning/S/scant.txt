[91m        SHORT  Scant is an adjective that means "a tiny amount," like your scant attendance at practice this week that results in being benched from the big game.[0m
[36m         LONG  Scant is also a verb, that means "to supply sparingly" ‚Äî don't scant with the brownies, or I will keep asking for more. Scant also means "to deal with
               inadequately or carelessly." When you scant the reports on homelessness, they are so superficial on data that they don't reflect the real
               problem. Scant comes from the Old Norse word skamt, meaning "short, brief."[0m
