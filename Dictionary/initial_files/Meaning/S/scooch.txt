[91m        SHORT  To screech is to make a piercing, high-pitched sound. It can also be the sound itself. Want to hear a screech? Take a little kid‚Äôs lollipop away.[0m
[36m         LONG  A screech is another word for a scream, shriek, or cry. It‚Äôs not fun to listen to. If a woman in a horror movie finds a bad guy in her closet, she‚Äôll probably
               screech. If you surprise someone in the middle of the night, expect a screech. Things can also screech, like when a car screeches to a sudden
               stop at a red light.[0m
