[91m        SHORT  When you're spiteful, you act in a mean way, with a desire to hurt someone. If your little brother was driving you crazy, you could calmly ignore him ‚Äî or you
               could give him a spiteful pinch.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you act or speak with the desire to hurt, bother, or infuriate someone, you are being spiteful. You could deliberately hurt someone's feelings or embarrass
               them with your spiteful words, or you could watch a jealous child give her friend a spiteful shove. The Latin word despectus, or "scorn or
               contempt," became the English despite, later shortened to spite, or "a desire to hurt someone."[0m
