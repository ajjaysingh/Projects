[91m        SHORT  Something that is subtle is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences of flavor that most people don't notice.[0m
[36m         LONG  Subtle is used for things that are hard to describe because of their complexity or delicacy: a way of thinking, arguing, or creating a work of art.  The word
               is pronounced like "suttle" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the b got imported to make the
               word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective subtilis. If you try to pronounce the b, your ignorance of how to say the word
               properly won't be very subtle![0m
