[91m        SHORT  Subjectivity refers to how someone‚Äôs judgment is shaped by personal opinions and feelings instead of outside influences. Subjectivity is partially responsible

[36m         LONG  Since a subject is a person, subjectivity refers to how a person's own uniqueness influences their perceptions. For example, if you have six sisters, that
               might influence how you view women or families ‚Äî it's part of your subjectivity. Subjectivity is a form of bias and also individuality.
               Subjectivity is the opposite of objectivity, which is based purely on the facts and isn't personal. We expect judges to put aside their
               subjectivity and make decisions based on objectivity.[0m
