[91m        SHORT  Something or someone that is supple bends and moves easily, like a contortionist at a circus sideshow. If you can wrap your legs around your neck, you most
               likely have a supple body.[0m
[36m         LONG  Supple is often used as an adjective describing a body ‚Äî such as a dancer‚Äôs; a fabric ‚Äî such as soft leather; or a sound ‚Äî such as an accomplished singer‚Äôs
               voice. This makes for a strange supple family, but all of its members can move with ease and flexibility. More idiomatically, supple can also
               be used to describe a mind. In this sense, it does not mean ‚Äúeasily brainwashed,‚Äù but has a more positive association with the open-mindedness
               of free-thinkers.[0m
