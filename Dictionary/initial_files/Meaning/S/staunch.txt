[36m         LONG  Staunch is sometimes used as a verb to mean "to stop the flow of a liquid," but most usage books will tell you it's better to use the word stanch for the
               verb. Think of a soldier stopping and standing still, and you will understand the connection between the two meanings. The adjectival form
               should make you think of "stand," as in ‚Äústand firm,‚Äù or "take a stand." It comes from the French estanche meaning ‚Äúwatertight‚Äù and the Latin
               stanticare, which is probably from stans for ‚Äústand.‚Äù[0m
