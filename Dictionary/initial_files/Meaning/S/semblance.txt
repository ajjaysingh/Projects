[91m        SHORT  Semblance is all about illusion. Cramming all of your dirty clothes into the closet gives the semblance, or false appearance, that you've done your laundry —
               but the stench might give you away.[0m
[36m         LONG  Semblance comes from the 14th-century French word for "resemble," and it is a noun for things that look one way on the outside but are very different on the
               inside. A popular combination is to say that a person or place has the "semblance of order," when, underneath, everything is out of control.[0m
