[91m        SHORT  If you know the movie you are about to see is satirical, you expect it to make fun some aspect of human nature or even our society, like a satirical take on

[36m         LONG  Satirical is an adjective that describes satire, a work that is intended to ridicule the shortcomings and antics of a person or group. So, something that is
               satirical often looks like the real thing in order to make fun of it. For example, a sketch on a comedy show in which a comedian sits behind a
               news anchor desk and uses a serious tone to "report" on absurd events that really happened takes a satirical approach to both the events and
               the concept of broadcast journalism.[0m
