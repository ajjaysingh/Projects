[91m        SHORT  A sentinel is a guard, a lookout, a person keeping watch. It's often a soldier, but not always. If you're watching a pot, waiting for it to boil, you're
               standing sentinel over it — and incidentally, it won't boil until you leave.[0m
[36m         LONG  Etymologists think sentinel stems from the Old Italian words sentina, meaning "vigilance," and  sentire, "to hear or perceive." It's a close cousin of sentry,
               which means the same thing. You can use sentinel as a noun or a verb. A kid in a snowball war might be the sentinel, patrolling the entrance to
               the fort. Wolves stand sentinel over their kill, stepping aside only for the alpha male, who always eats first.[0m
