[91m        SHORT  If you get into trouble in England, don't ask for a lawyer. Find a solicitor. England has two levels of attorneys: for big problems, you'll need a barrister,
               but for your hypothetical legal troubles, a solicitor should do nicely.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some highly place attorneys in the U.S. are also called solicitors. The lawyer in charge of government cases that come before the Supreme Court is the
               Solicitor General, and that was Elena Kagan's job before President Barack Obama appointed her to the Supreme Court.  Solicitor isnâ€™t always a
               privileged position. The person who knocks on your door asking you to contribute to some worthy cause is also a solicitor â€” someone who asks
               for â€” or solicits â€” donations.[0m
