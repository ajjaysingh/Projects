[91m        SHORT  Ever snore at the opera? Burp at the dinner table? Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three, right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what
               you did was commit a solecism. Sounds kinda neat that way, huh?[0m
[36m         LONG  The origin of solecism comes from the ancient Greek word meaning "speaking incorrectly," and solecism does have another meaning that's more specifically
               verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as
               burping at the dinner table. Well, almost.[0m
