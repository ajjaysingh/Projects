[91m        SHORT  If you want to go out in style, buy yourself a sarcophagus ‚Äî a very fancy coffin usually decorated with elaborate carvings. If King Tut could arrange it, so
               can you![0m
[36m         LONG  Sarcophagus comes from the Greek word sarkophagos meaning "limestone used for coffins." But the Greek literally translates to mean "flesh-eating." Seems a bit
               gruesome, doesn't it? This translation makes sense when you figure that limestone was used in coffins because it quickly decomposed the body.
               These stone coffins are usually decorated with a sculpture or inscription and date back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Rome, and
               Greece.[0m
