[91m        SHORT  Sleuth is a fun, sometimes playful, word for "detective."  As a verb, it's also what a detective does. When you seek clues, you sleuth.  You, sleuth, you![0m
[36m         LONG  The word sleuth comes from the Old Norse sloth, meaning "trail" and sleuthing is following a trail.  One type of bloodhound skilled at following trails is
               called a sleuthhound, and that word was shortened to sleuth in the late 19th Century, referring to an investigator.  As an amateur sleuth, you
               caught the robber dressed as a mummy before the police did.  He would have escaped if not for you, you meddling sleuth![0m
