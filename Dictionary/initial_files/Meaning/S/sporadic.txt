[91m        SHORT  Sporadic is an adjective that you can use to refer to something that happens or appears often, but not constantly or regularly. The mail carrier comes every
               day but the plumber's visits are sporadic‚Äì‚Äìhe comes as needed.[0m
[36m         LONG  A specialized use of sporadic is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an epidemic.  English borrowed the
               word sporadic from Greek sporadik√≥s "scattered." A very near synonym is intermittent.[0m
