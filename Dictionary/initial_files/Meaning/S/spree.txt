[91m        SHORT  If you go on a spree, you go a little wild, indulging in some activity in an unrestrained way. You might go on a cupcake spree every year on your birthday,
               eating as many cupcakes as you can.[0m
[36m         LONG  Following your impulses and giving in to them ‚Äî rather than resisting or limiting them ‚Äî is one way to go on a spree. It can be a dancing spree, in which you
               dance all night long, or a shopping spree, in which you max out your credit card at the mall. The original slang meaning, and one that's still
               used today, is "a drinking bout," and it may be rooted in the French word esprit, "lively wit."[0m
