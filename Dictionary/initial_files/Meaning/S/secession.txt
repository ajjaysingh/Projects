[36m         LONG  You could think of secession as a kind of divorce for governments, an official and often lasting split between an alliance, federation, or other political
               group. Secession is the noun version of the verb secede (meaning to withdraw from an organization), and when a secession takes place the group
               doing the seceding makes a formal departure from the original group. A famous example of political secession happened right before the American
               Civil War, when eleven southern states withdrew from the U.S. government over the issue of slavery.[0m
