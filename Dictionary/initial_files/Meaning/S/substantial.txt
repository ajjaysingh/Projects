[36m         LONG  The adjective substantial derives from the Latin substantia "substance," which means "stuff." A substantial meal is large enough to satisfy hunger. A
               substantial structure is strongly made or built. And a substantial man possesses wealth and property. Related to this last sense, "a man of
               substance" refers to a wealthy man with property.[0m
