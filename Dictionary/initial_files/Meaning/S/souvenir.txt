[91m        SHORT  A souvenir is a keepsake or a remembrance. A telltale sign that someone has visited Paris is the tiny, metal Eiffel Tower hanging from her keychain as a
               souvenir.[0m
[36m         LONG  First recorded in 1775 as meaning ‚Äúa remembrance or memory,‚Äù the noun souvenir stems from the French souvenir ‚Äúto remember, come to mind.‚Äù A few years later,
               it took on the sense of ‚Äúa token‚Äù of an event or experience. A song by Tears for Fears goes, ‚ÄúLove is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given
               never forgotten, never let it disappear.‚Äù Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but more often it refers to something tangible, like a memento,
               gift, or trophy.[0m
