[91m        SHORT  To sear something is to quickly cook or burn its surface by applying intense heat. When making beef stew, the color and flavor are usually better if you sear
               the meat first.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sear comes from the Old English word searian which meant ‚Äúdry up‚Äù or ‚Äúwither.‚Äù  Typically, the verb sear now refers to burning or scorching something with
               heat, but if you see the phrase ‚Äúwind-seared,‚Äù it means that a place ‚Äî or something left in that place ‚Äî has been withered by exposure to the
               elements. An unpleasant image can be seared into your memory, meaning you can't forget it.[0m
