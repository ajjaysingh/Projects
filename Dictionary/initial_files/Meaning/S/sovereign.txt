[91m        SHORT  Put simply, your sovereign is your king or queen. George III was the sovereign of Great Britain and her colonies ‚Äî including the American ones. At least, he
               was until a little thing called the Revolutionary War upset everything.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sovereign as an adjective can be used to indicate the ultimate power of a state, whether a monarchy or not, as in "Peru exercised its sovereign rights to all
               minerals within its borders." A sovereign is also a British gold coin with a face value of one pound sterling (with the monarch's face on it).
               But don't sell it for a pound, because it's worth its weight in gold ‚Äî quite literally ‚Äî which is a lot more than a pound is worth.[0m
