[36m         LONG  A shack is a tiny, crude shelter that one person might be living in. It’s not well maintained, and it probably has peeling paint and a leaky roof. A shack is
               a big step below a house and a small step above a refrigerator box. To shack is to live somewhere, especially somewhere that's not nice.
               Shacking up is kind of like crashing on someone’s couch, or living somewhere temporarily.[0m
