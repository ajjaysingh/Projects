[36m         LONG  Slavery, a brutal form of servitude, existed in the United States until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Before this, thousands upon
               thousands of African Americans were forced into servitude, where they were forced to perform labor for their masters. A key to remembering the
               meaning of servitude is the fact that it resembles servant.    If your friend rear-ends you but doesn't have insurance, let him pay for the
               damage in servitude. Make him your personal assistant for a month![0m
