[36m         LONG  It is hard to believe that the ocean, whipped by winds during a storm, can ever return to a state of serenity, where its surface looks like glass. Serenity is
               from Latin serenus "calm, peaceful" plus the suffix  -itas. The first part of the word is the English adjective serene, which means calm and
               peaceful. The Latin suffix corresponds to our English suffix -ity and has the meaning "quality or state."[0m
