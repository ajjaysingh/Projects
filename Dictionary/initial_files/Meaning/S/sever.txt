[91m        SHORT  To sever something is to cut it off from the whole. If your girlfriend breaks up with you on your anniversary, you might respond by severing the blossoms off
               the roses you were planning to give her. (Just an idea.)[0m
[36m         LONG  Sever rhymes with ever, but it looks like the word severe, which means "harsh." The similarity between sever and severe is a good reminder to reserve sever
               for harsh, unpleasant circumstances. If you‚Äôre trimming your fingernails, you might use the word clip, but sever wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate. If,
               however, you somehow cut off your finger while clipping your fingernails, you‚Äôre free to use the word sever ‚Äî or any other word you like ‚Äî on
               your way to the hospital.[0m
