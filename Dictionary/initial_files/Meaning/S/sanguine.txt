[36m         LONG  Sanguine is from Latin sanguis "blood" and originally meant "bloody" ‚Äî in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an
               optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that "bodily humors" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no
