[91m        SHORT  A spectre is a ghost or spirit. If you see a spectre of the previous owners in your new house, get out quick! A spectre can also be a thought that haunts you.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word spectre (or specter) has to do with being haunted ‚Äî it can be something that literally haunts you, like the ghost of your Aunt Sally who bangs the
               windows every night. You can also say that a reminder of something painful is a spectre. A spectre can also be a fear of something dreadful
               happening in the future, like the spectre of a second ice age. Spectre is generally the British spelling, while Americans prefer specter.[0m
