[91m        SHORT  If something stands out in a very obvious way, it can be called salient. It's time to find new friends if the differences between you and your current friends
               are becoming more and more salient.[0m
[36m         LONG  Salient, from the Latin verb salire "to leap," was originally used in English to refer to leaping animals such as a frog or deer and may still be used this
               way. Often, however, it is used in math or geography to mean protruding. A salient angle juts outward rather than inward. Figuratively, it
               means noticeable or prominent. When giving an argument, make your most salient points at the beginning or the end.[0m
