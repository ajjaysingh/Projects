[36m         LONG  One of the scariest parts of "The Wizard of Oz" is when the winged monkeys pounce on the Scarecrow and strew his insides all over the forest floor. It's a
               tricky word, because it sounds the same in the present as it does in the past. The monkeys strew the straw then and might strew it now: in any
               case, the straw will be strewn all over. After the clambake, the beach was strewn with empty shells and beer bottles. After  strewing all that
               stuff, they forgot to clean up.[0m
