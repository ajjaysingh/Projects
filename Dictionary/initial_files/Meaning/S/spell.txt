[91m        SHORT  A spell is a series of words that has magical powers. If you‚Äôre under a spell, then what you do is out of your control ‚Äî your thoughts and actions are
               dictated by the spell.[0m
[36m         LONG  Spell can refer to the magic words you say, or it can describe being under the influence of those words. You probably don‚Äôt encounter many magic spells in
               real life, but the word is often used figuratively to describe those times when you feel like a magical power controls your action. Of course,
               this word can also mean the verb "to spell" which refers to reciting the letters in a word, like the competitive spellers in a spelling bee.[0m
