[36m         LONG  If someone is dark, dour, glum, moody, morose, or sour, they're also sullen. Teenagers are often described as sullen, especially when they're being grumpy and
               silent. You often hear about "a sullen silence," which is when someone is quiet, but obviously in a lousy mood. If a sullen person is talking,
               they're probably not saying much, and they might not be doing much beyond grunting. A sullen person isn't much fun to be around.[0m
