[91m        SHORT  Senility refers to mental deterioration that often comes with old age, as in severe memory problems. If you find your shoes in the fridge or accidentally call
               your son by the dog's name, you may wonder if senility is kicking in.[0m
[36m         LONG  Senility is related to the word senile, which itself is from the Latin word senilis, meaning "old age." There are subtle differences between senility and
               Alzheimer's disease, which causes memory loss as well as emotional and behavioral changes. If you suspect someone you care about is
               experiencing senility or Alzheimer's disease, you should consult a physician because treatments may be available to help slow the process.[0m
