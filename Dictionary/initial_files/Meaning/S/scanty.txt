[91m        SHORT  We refer to an amount or thing that is not quite enough as scanty, or lacking. It's an adjective used to describe something that doesn't offer enough, as in
               "farmers having a scanty crop in a drought year."[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective scanty comes from the Old Norse scamt, which means "short or brief," and so suggests a small amount. The word usually suggests a meager amount,
               and can refer to anything that is barely sufficient. Someone trying to stretch a meal might offer scanty servings. On a humorous note, a
               Roaring Twenties flapper referred to her underwear as scanties.[0m
