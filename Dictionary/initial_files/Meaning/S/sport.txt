[91m        SHORT  Sport has many definitions, the most familiar of which is a game involving physical exertion ‚Äî think tennis or hockey. Randomly, sport can also mean to wear,
               as in, "he looked sharp sporting a yellow sport coat."[0m
[36m         LONG  Most of the definitions of sport involve the idea of fun, or of something being fair. Hopefully organized sports are both. A sporting chance means a player in
               a game has a fair chance of winning. A good sport is someone who plays fair, and wins and loses graciously. If you torture flies for sport, you
               do it for fun, and that's just wrong. If you make sport of your little sister's stutter, you make fun of it, and that's even worse.[0m
