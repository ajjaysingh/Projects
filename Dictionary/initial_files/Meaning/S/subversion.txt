[91m        SHORT  Subversion means overthrowing something, like a government or law, or it can mean corrupting someone‚Äôs personal morals, like making a vegetarian eat bacon by
               tricking her.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin root subvertere means ‚Äúto turn from below,‚Äù and when you turn something on its head in a sneaky way, that‚Äôs subversion.  Imagine digging a hole in
               the ground, then covering the hole with a layer of sticks and leaves.  When someone walks on it, they fall in.  That‚Äôs the basic idea of
               subversion, attacking from below.  People often use subversion to take down a corrupt government, and acts of subversion are a powerful way to
               protest injustice.[0m
