[91m        SHORT  Surly describes behavior nobody wants to be around. Think of the irritable old guy who lives on your street and always seems to be simmering with some sullen
               nasty anger, whose every utterance he spits out with a rude snarl. He's the poster boy for surly.[0m
[36m         LONG  Surly behavior is always frowned upon, but the word's origins are in the behavior of English nobility. Surly's roots are in sirly, as in sir, meaning
               arrogant, haughty and superior. Its current meaning implies all that and more, none of it appealing. To be rude, snotty, sullen, mean and
               cranky can be added to the list. Generally speaking, if you find yourself in a surly mood, avoid your friends and loved ones.[0m
