[36m         LONG  Specious is pronounced "SPEE-shuhs." Something that is specious is attractive in a deceptive way, and if you follow the word's etymology, you'll see why. In
               Middle English, this adjective meant "attractive," from Latin speci≈çsus "showy, beautiful," from speciƒìs "appearance, kind, sort." Latin
               speciƒìs is also the source of English species.[0m
