[91m        SHORT  A scribe is a term for someone employed to make written copies of documents. Before printing was invented, the busy scribes in a village would write copies of

[36m         LONG  As a noun, scribe has several meanings. It's used as an informal term to refer to journalists. Scribe also refers to a sharply pointed tool used for marking
               wood or metal to be cut. As a verb, it means "to score a line on something with a pointed instrument." The master craftsmen instructed you to
               scribe a line on the piece of wood where he pointed, to mark the spot where he wanted it cut.[0m
