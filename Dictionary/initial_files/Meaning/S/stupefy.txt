[36m         LONG  Stupefy looks a lot like stupid. But intelligence has nothing to do with being stupefied, which comes from Latin and means "to make stunned." Anyone can be
               stupefied by something scary, mysterious, or just plain remarkable. Think of tourists visiting New York City for the first time. They stare up
               at the skyscrapers, lost in wonder. Taking that moment to let themselves be amazed? Nothing stupid about it, unless they step on someone's
               foot, of course.[0m
