[36m         LONG  Stalemate is from an Old French word, estal, which means ‚Äúplace,‚Äù ‚Äúposition,‚Äù or ‚Äústand.‚Äù To be in a stalemate with an opponent is to be in a locked position,
               or a stalled place, where neither player can make a profitable move. Chess is the most common context for a stalemate, but any contest or
               negotiation can result in a stalemate: "The discussions about buying their competitor‚Äôs waffle house reached a stalemate and the deal died."[0m
