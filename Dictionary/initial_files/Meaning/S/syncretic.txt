	Wiki Definition:
              	Syncretism  is a union or attempted fusion of different religions, cultures, or philosophies â€” like Halloween, which has both Christian and pagan roots, or
               the combination of Aristotelian philosophy with the belief system of the early punk rock practitioners.
