[91m        SHORT  If it's the day before a big event and you have no idea what to wear and nothing in your closet is going to cut it, you are facing a sartorial dilemma ‚Äî one
               that pertains to clothing, fashion, or dressing.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sartorial comes from the Modern Latin word sartor which means "tailor," literally "one who patches and mends." In English the adjectives sartorial and
               sartorially are used to refer to any matter pertaining to the consideration of clothing or fashion. The root word sartor has also made its way
               into the field of biology. The sartorius ‚Äî a muscle in the leg and the longest muscle in the human body ‚Äî gets its name because it is used when
               crossing the legs, also known as the ‚Äútailor's position."[0m
