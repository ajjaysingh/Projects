[91m        SHORT  Medieval alchemists ascribed to the planet Saturn a gloomy and slow character. When people are called saturnine, it means they are like the planet––gloomy,
               mean, scowling. Not exactly the life of the party.[0m
[36m         LONG  Saturnine is a word you don't hear often nowadays, though you probably know people with saturnine dispositions. The ultimate saturnine character in literature
               is Heathcliff––and for clarification's sake, that would be the brooding, bitter, obsessed hero of "Wuthering Heights," not the lovably pudgy
               cat of comic-strip fame.[0m
