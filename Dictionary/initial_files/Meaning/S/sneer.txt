[91m        SHORT  If your smile is contorted with contempt or your upper lip curled with distaste and disdain, you're probably sneering. And you should stop, because it isn't
               nice.[0m
[36m         LONG  Many things can elicit a sneer:  a terrible red carpet outfit, a disgusting plate of food, a stupid joke told for the third time. But sneers aren't just meant
               to show disgust. They're mean-spirited, mocking and often downright snooty. So now that you know the definition of sneer inside and out, resist
               the temptation to sneer at those who don't![0m
