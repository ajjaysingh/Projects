[91m        SHORT  The noun stint means a set amount of time in which you do something — often work of some sort. "She served a stint in the army, followed by a stint in an
               office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge singer."[0m
[36m         LONG  Unlike a project or vocation, a stint can refer to the stretch of time spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to your past stint in
               the Peace Corps. As a verb, stint means to be sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner ("to skimp"). "The school board chose to make
               cuts at the administrative level, rather than stint on the children's education."[0m
