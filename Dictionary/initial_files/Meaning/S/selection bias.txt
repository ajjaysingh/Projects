[36m         LONG  Inside selection is the word select, "to choose." Selection means the act of choosing, the thing chosen, or the offerings to be chosen from among. Selection
               can also mean a passage excerpted (or selected) from a longer text. Church services often involve reading a day's selection from the Bible.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Selection bias  is the  bias  introduced by the  selection  of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not
               achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. It is sometimes referred
               to as the  selection  effect.
