[36m         LONG  There are many types of luggage people use for carrying their belongings, such as suitcases, briefcases, purses, backpacks, and duffel bags. Another is the
               satchel, which is a small or medium-sized case with a flat bottom. A satchel usually has a shoulder strap which makes it easier to carry, and
               it's often full of books. The word satchel is related to sack, both coming from the Latin root saccus, or "bag."[0m
