[91m        SHORT  If you have a cushy job ‚Äî one that pays, but involves minimal work ‚Äî then you have a sinecure. "Because he was the brother of the CEO, he was offered a
               sinecure in the company: he showed up each day and collected a pay check, but others actually did his work."[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun sinecure comes from the Latin root words sine cura meaning "without care." It originally was used to describe a church position that did not include
               caring for the souls of parishioners, but that meaning is considered archaic now. The word is now usually associated with political
               appointments.[0m
