[36m         LONG  If you box, you might spar with an opponent at the gym while you're training. You don't strike too hard ‚Äî it‚Äôs just practice. Similarly, if you spar with
               words, you typically do it playfully and without anger. You might repeatedly spar with your mom about who makes the best meatloaf, but it‚Äôs
               all in good fun. Spar is also the name of a rigging pole, as well as of some light minerals like calcite, that you can cut through.[0m
