[91m        SHORT  A steward is someone who takes care of the grounds or animals of a particular place. If your parents are always traveling and you have to take care of your
               six younger siblings, you probably feel like the steward of the house.[0m
[36m         LONG  You might have heard the term "stewardess," a female flight attendant, but the name has trickled out of use in favor of the gender-neutral "flight attendant."
               A steward is the male version of that. Anyone who takes care of places or people is a steward. You can be a steward of artifacts from an
               architectural dig. You can also be elected to be the steward of your co-workers retirement fund. Either way, someone's trusting you with their
               stuff.[0m
