[36m         LONG  If you are on the part of the earth that is pointed towards the sun on the solstice, you are probably enjoying the longest day of summer. If you're pointed
               away, it is the shortest day of winter. Some people who do not believe in organized religion but like the idea of bringing lights inside and
               brightening a dark season celebrate the winter solstice, which falls a few days before Christmas.[0m
