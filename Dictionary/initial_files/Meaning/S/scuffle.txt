[91m        SHORT  As both a noun and a verb, scuffle involves a fight. As a noun, it is the clash itself, like a scuffle between sworn enemies. As a verb, it means to fight,
               like a bully who will scuffle with just about anyone.[0m
[36m         LONG  A scuffle is not an organized bout: it is a free-for-all, with fists flying in any and all directions. As a verb, it tells about the act of this kind of wild
               fighting, like angry kids who scuffle to try to settle their problems, but it can also mean "dragging one's feet while walking." Here, the
               meaning is not related to fighting, but rather the sound made by those shuffling feet.[0m
