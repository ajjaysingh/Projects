[91m        SHORT  Shrink is the informal word you can use to talk about a therapist. Talking about your problems with her can hopefully help you shrink them, or make them
               smaller.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word shrink is related to the Swedish skrynka meaning "to wrinkle." Think about what happens to a lone forgotten fruit at the bottom of your fridge
               drawer. After a while, it begins to wrinkle or shrink. Clothes washed in hot water tend to shrink, so be wary of the setting on your washing
               machine. The use of shrink as referring to therapists started as late as the 1960s ‚Äî with the idea of a psychologist being a "head-shrinker."[0m
