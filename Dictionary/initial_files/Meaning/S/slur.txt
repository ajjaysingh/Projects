[91m        SHORT  A slur is an insulting remark. In a political campaign, it‚Äôs not unheard of for a candidate to launch a slur at her opponent, though doing so is usually
               frowned upon.[0m
[36m         LONG  Slur can also be used as a verb meaning ‚Äúto insult,‚Äù and it has a number of additional meanings as well. To slur one‚Äôs speech is to pronounce words in a
               clumsy, lazy way. In the context of music, to slur is to slide smoothly from one note to another. The word history of slur is hazy, but some
               scholars have suggested a relationship with a Dutch word meaning "to drag."[0m
