[91m        SHORT  A sadist is someone who enjoys inflicting pain on others, sometimes in a sexual sense. Sadists like seeing other people hurt.[0m
[36m         LONG  A sadist is the opposite of a masochist, who enjoys being in pain. A sadist is all about hurting others, usually to get off sexually. However, this word is
               about more than sex. Anyone who is mean and enjoys it ‚Äî like a bully ‚Äî could be considered a sadist. Anyone who tortures another human being is
               almost certainly a sadist. Unfortunately, we can all be a sadist at certain moments. If you've ever been mean to someone and enjoyed it, you
               were being a little sadistic.[0m
