[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôve ever attended a funeral, you were probably struck by how quiet, earnest, and solemn the mood was.  You can use the word solemn to describe anything
               that's really serious and dignified.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective solemn comes from the Latin sollemnis, which means formal or ceremonial. You can still use it to describe a ceremony or event, but it's also a
               good word for talking about someone who's serious and sincere and maybe lacks a sense of humor about certain things.  Here's a trick for
               remembering it: Think of a "sole man," a serious guy standing alone at a party talking to no one.[0m
