[91m        SHORT  Because meteors move through the sky so quickly, we often refer to something moving very fast as meteoric. A newly-popular singer might be said to experience
               a meteoric rise to the top. (The fall can be meteoric, too.)[0m
[36m         LONG  The "-ic" suffix on a word creates an adjective meaning "with the characteristics of." So meteoric means ‚Äúhaving the characteristics of a meteor.‚Äù Both words
               take their origin from the Greek mete≈çros, meaning "high up." By the way, a shooting star is meteoric, being a meteor that is burning up as it
               plunges through the earth's atmosphere.[0m
