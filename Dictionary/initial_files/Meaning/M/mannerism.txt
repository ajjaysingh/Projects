[91m        SHORT  Does someone you know always shrug in a particular way or say "You know what I mean?" at the end of every sentence? Well, that's a mannerism, a habitual
               gesture or way of speaking.[0m
[36m         LONG  Generally, we don't use then term mannerism as a critical term for our friends' behavior, but when applied as a term of art criticism, it can be a negative
               thing. If a critic talks about a writer's mannerisms, for example, it's probably intended as an insult ‚Äî suggesting they're writing in a lazy
               or clich√©d way. However, Mannerism, with a capital "M," refers to a specific 16th-century Italian style of painting known for its artificial
               (as opposed to naturalistic) effects.[0m
