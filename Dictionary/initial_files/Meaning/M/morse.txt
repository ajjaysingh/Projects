[91m        SHORT  A morsel is a small amount of something, a tid-bit, a sliver, usually of something of high-quality and much desired ‚Äî like a morsel of dark chocolate or a
               morsel of secret information.[0m
[36m         LONG  Originally it referred specifically to food ‚Äî a nineteenth century lady might partake of a "dainty morsel" to eat, for example. More often than not morsel now
               refers to non-food items: a morsel of good taste; a morsel of common sense, and, of course, most popular of all, a morsel of gossip. That's
               why, like all good food, all good gossip is juicy.[0m
