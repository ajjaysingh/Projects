[91m        SHORT  Modesty is that shy feeling you get when someone brags about how great you are, or when you need to take off your shirt to go swimming and showing skin makes
               you squirm.  If you blush, you’ve got some modesty.[0m
[36m         LONG  Modesty comes from the Latin modestus, which literally translates as “keeping due measure.”  Knowing the correct measure of yourself is modesty, and when
               someone praises you too much, your modesty might kick in and make you want to tell them to be quiet.  Modesty also means you keep things decent
               and not too outrageous, like wearing clothes that hide your skin, or painting your walls beige instead of covering them with glow-in-the-dark
               diamond wallpaper.[0m
