[91m        SHORT  Multifaceted means having many aspects or sides. Diamonds are usually cut to be multifaceted, that is, with many angled flat surfaces, because this increases
               their ability to reflect light.[0m
[36m         LONG  Since facet means "aspect," "side," or "face," multifaceted means "many aspects, sides, or faces." This can apply to jewels or other physical objects, like
               the eyes of a dragonfly, but it can also refer to complicated issues that have lots of contributing factors and generate more than two sides to
               an argument. A multifaceted person has many abilities, or a personality with many sides to it.[0m
