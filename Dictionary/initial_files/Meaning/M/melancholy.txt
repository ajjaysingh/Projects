[91m        SHORT  Melancholy is beyond sad: as a noun or an adjective, it's a word for the gloomiest of spirits.[0m
[36m         LONG  Being melancholy means that you're overcome in sorrow, wrapped up in sorrowful thoughts. The word started off as a noun for deep sadness, from a rather
               disgusting source. Back in medieval times, people thought that secretions of the body called "humors" determined their feelings, so a depressed
               person was thought to have too much of the humor known as melancholy ‚Äî literally "black bile" secreted from the spleen. Fortunately, we no
               longer think we're ruled by our spleens, and that black bile has been replaced by another color of sorrow: the "blues."[0m
