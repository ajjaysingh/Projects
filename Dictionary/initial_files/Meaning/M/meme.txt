[36m         LONG  A cultural idea, value, habit, or even something like a tune is a meme if it is picked up from someone else. A meme, which is pronounced "meem," will change
               over time, like younger kids who want to wear the exact same clothes but who eventually develop their own, though similar, styles. Recently,
               meme has become commonly used to refer to Internet memes ‚Äî pictures, videos, or even slang words that are shared between Internet users.[0m
