[91m        SHORT  To mourn is to grieve for someone who has died, especially a loved one. One of the hardest experiences of childhood is when you mourn the loss of a beloved
               pet.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can also mourn for things that you've lost, not only pets and people who have died. If your local library branch is forced to close, you might mourn its
               loss, missing being able to walk there from your house. The Old English root word of mourn is murnan, which means not only to mourn, but also
               to be anxious. Related words include "mourner" and "mournful."[0m
