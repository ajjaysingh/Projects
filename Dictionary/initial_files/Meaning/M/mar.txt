[91m        SHORT  A mar is a flaw, mark, or blemish, like a deep scratch on a wooden table. As a verb, to mar is to make such an imperfection ‚Äî like the pen mark that mars your
               crisp, white shirt.[0m
[36m         LONG  We often think of things that mar as immediately noticeable, like scratches, scars, and blemishes, but sometimes mar describes other ways of ruining
               something. For example, an unexpected run-in with a difficult person can mar your relaxing day at the beach, just as an unpleasant memory can
               mar a peaceful state of mind. The thing to remember is, it only takes one scratch, one mean comment, or one negative experience to mar
               something that is otherwise fine.[0m
