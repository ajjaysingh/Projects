[91m        SHORT  Misfeasance happens when someone in authority uses her position to do something wrong. If a town's mayor uses his influence to get jobs for his family
               members, that's misfeasance.[0m
[36m         LONG  One way to define misfeasance is "the wrongful exercise of lawful authority." In other words, the power or authority is legal and fair, but the way it's being
               used is harmful. If a judge, sheriff, city councilor, or other public official acts in a way they know will cause harm, it's considered
               misfeasance. This legal term comes from an Old French word, mesfaire, "to misdo," which combines the roots mes-, "wrongly," and faire, "to do."[0m
