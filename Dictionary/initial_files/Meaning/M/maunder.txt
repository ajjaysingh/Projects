[91m        SHORT  When you maunder, you talk in a rambling mutter. People being questioned by reporters should try to answer articulately ‚Äî they shouldn't just maunder in

[36m         LONG  The difference between a great speech and an interminably boring one is that a good speaker keeps it short (and often funny), but a bad one tends to maunder
               in a mumbling voice. A novelist who tends to have her characters maunder on endlessly needs a skilled editor. Although maunder sometimes also
               means "wander aimlessly," it doesn't come from the similar meander but probably from a root meaning "to beg."[0m
