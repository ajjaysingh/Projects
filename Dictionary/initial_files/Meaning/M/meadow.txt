[91m        SHORT  The noun meadow is another word for a hayfield, but offers a much more picturesque view as an open field of lush grass filled with butterflies and birds, with
               room to run. It can also refer to a piece of land found along a river.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word meadow refers to any grassland or hayfield, often just an expansive area that should be mowed. Indeed, the word comes from the Old English word m√¶d
               from the Germanic  m√¶dwon the base of which means ‚Äúmow.‚Äù Still, the bucolic feeling is retained, as Dale Carnegie put it: ‚ÄúLet us not get so
               busy or live so fast that we can't listen to the music of the meadow or the symphony that glorifies the forest."[0m
