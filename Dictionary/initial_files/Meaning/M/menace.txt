[91m        SHORT  If it's threatening you or otherwise posing some sort of danger, then it's a menace. Angry rabid dogs, smog clouds, and annoying little brothers are all
               probable menaces.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word menace works as both a noun and a verb, but it wasn't used to describe threatening or bothersome people until 1936. Before then, common menaces
               probably included things like the plague, locusts, and roving bands of pirate ships. Today, a bad reputation can menace an otherwise promising
               career, weeds can menace your garden, and burglars are a menace to society.[0m
