[91m        SHORT  A massacre is a big bloody mess of killing, and usually for no good reason.  Not that there‚Äôs ever a good reason for killing, but massacres are especially
               pointless and gory.[0m
[36m         LONG  It‚Äôs unclear where the word massacre came from, but possibly it was the Old French word macacre, which means ‚Äúslaughterhouse.‚Äù  As a noun, massacre is a
               brutal slaughter of humans or animals, and it can be a verb as well, like when an army massacres an entire village of innocent people.
               Pronounce it like MASS-uh-ker, and remember to spell it with an acre at the end, which is how much land is needed to bury the bodies after a
               massacre.[0m
