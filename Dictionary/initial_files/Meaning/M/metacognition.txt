[91m        SHORT  When a James Bond villain comes up with a plan to destroy the world, he doesn‚Äôt use a simple plan. No, he uses a machination ‚Äî a complex plot that relies on
               numerous elements coming together to work.[0m
[36m         LONG  Not surprisingly, machination derives from the Medieval French machina, meaning "machine." And, like many a machine, a machination is subject to going wrong,
               often comically (see James Bond movies). Politicians love a good machination, and their machinations are frequently exposed in the press as
               scandals.[0m
