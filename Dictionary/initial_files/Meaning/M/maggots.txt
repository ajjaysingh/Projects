[91m        SHORT  A maggot is a small, wormlike fly larva. Maggots are sometimes found in garbage, compost piles, or other places where they can feed on decaying plants and
               organic matter. Yum.[0m
[36m         LONG  The nicest way to think of a maggot is as a baby fly â€” when maggots grow up, that's just what they become. Because maggot isn't a strictly scientific term,
               its definition can be vague, sometimes meaning "grub" and other times, "larva" in general. Maggots are usually found in a large, wriggling
               group, and can be harmful to farm animals with cuts or sores, as they can infest their skin.[0m
