[91m        SHORT  A mire is mushy ground like quicksand, so if you feel yourself trapped in a sticky situation, consider yourself mired. One gets mired IN something ‚Äî like in a
               dispute or in a love triangle.[0m
[36m         LONG  Mire still has its original, though less-used, sense of a slushy, muddy bit of land that gives way underfoot, also known as a quagmire. One of the most famous
               mires in literary history was the one haunted by the Hound of the Baskervilles in Conan Doyle's classic. Have the fibs you told your beloved
               come back to haunt you? You're stuck in a mire then, a treacherous situation it's going to be pretty hard to squirm out of.[0m
