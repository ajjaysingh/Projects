[91m        SHORT  To meddle is to interfere. You can meddle in someone else's affairs, and you can meddle with someone else's things. Either way, you‚Äôre messing with someone
               else‚Äôs stuff and she probably doesn‚Äôt like it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Meddle started out in the late 1400‚Äôs meaning ‚Äúto mingle,‚Äù then it became a pain when it began to be used to mean ‚Äúinterfere,‚Äù which is how we use it now. For
               a little while there it also meant to be, um, romantic with someone, but it‚Äôs not used that way today. Meddle is what little sisters do, always
               getting in the middle of your business.[0m
