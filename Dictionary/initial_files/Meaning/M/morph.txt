[91m        SHORT  To morph is to change from one shape to another. A cute bunny, for example, might morph into a killer dragon in a fairy tale or an animated film.[0m
[36m         LONG  Morph comes from the word metamorphosis, which is a Greek word meaning "a transforming." As a verb, it has only been around since the 1980s, when computers
               allowed animators to make things change shape in an apparently seamlessly way. With the right skills, you can morph a toaster into a highly
               intelligent robot that helps fight crime, offers dating advice to the protagonist of the film, and still makes an excellent piece of toast.[0m
