[91m        SHORT  A malady is an illness, like a malady that keeps you home, sick in bed for days, or something that causes you to have trouble or to suffer, like jet lag — a
               malady that affects travelers.[0m
[36m         LONG  Malady, pronounced "MAL-uh-dee," comes from the Latin words male, meaning "bad or ill" and habitus for "have, hold." When you have a malady, it is like
               something bad is holding you, such as an illness — the common cold: a malady of winter. Some bad habits cause maladies, such as never having
               any money — the malady of people who spend freely, not thinking of the future.[0m
