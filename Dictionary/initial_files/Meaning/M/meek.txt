[91m        SHORT  The adjective meek describes a person who is willing to go along with whatever other people want to do, like a meek classmate who won't speak up, even when he
               or she is treated unfairly.[0m
[36m         LONG  A meek person can also be humble, but these words aren't quite synonyms. If you are humble, you don't want a lot of attention, like the humble athlete who has
               a truly excellent performance yet after the game, tells reporters that it was group effort by the whole team. A meek person, on the other hand,
               would never think a reporter would ever want to talk to him or her, and if asked, would probably try to get someone else, someone more
               "worthy," to do it.[0m
