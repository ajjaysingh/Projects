[91m        SHORT  Add the Greek prefix "meta-" (beyond) to the base "physical" (nature), and you get metaphysical ‚Äî a near synonym to the Latin-based word "supernatural." Both
               concern phenomena that are outside everyday experience or knowledge.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective metaphysical entered the English language through Aristotle, whose "Metaphysics" is a collection of treatises that follows his work, "Physics."
               "Physics" concerned natural philosophy, what we call science today, while "Metaphysics" dealt with more abstract questions about the reality
               beyond what we perceive with our senses. Look at a physical object, say an apple. At what exact point did that apple come into existence? If
               you eat it, does it cease to exist, or does it still exist but in a changed way? These are metaphysical questions.[0m
