[91m        SHORT  A large, densely populated urban area is called a metropolis. "She liked living in a metropolis because there were many opportunities in a city that were not
               available elsewhere, like 24-hour diners."[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun metropolis comes from the Greek roots mƒìtƒìr, meaning "mother," and p√≥lis, meaning "city." Historically, the word referred to the founding city-state
               of a region in Ancient Greece. Today the word refers to any urban area. The largest metropolis in Massachusetts is Boston, which is also the
               capital. Sometimes people use the word metropolis ironically or sarcastically: "She came from the booming metropolis of Tumbleweed, population
               325."[0m
