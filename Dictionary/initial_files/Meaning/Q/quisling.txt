[91m        SHORT  A quisling is a traitor, especially one who collaborates with an enemy occupying force for personal gain.[0m
[36m         LONG  The term arose because in World War II, Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian politician, volunteered to help the occupying Nazis rule Norway for Germany. Quisling was
               tried for treason and executed at the end of the war, and his name became synonymous with traitor and collaborator. The word quisling is not
               commonly used in the United States, however, probably because the American term for a traitor is "Benedict Arnold," the name of a Revolutionary
               War turncoat.[0m
