[91m        SHORT  How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a quandary: a tough situation
               that will be really hard to resolve.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you‚Äôre uncertain what to do because all of your options seem unpleasant, you‚Äôre probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves in a quandary when they
               dislike all of the candidates. A more common quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can‚Äôt decide which one to attend. Some
               synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight, and pickle ‚Äî and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself.[0m
