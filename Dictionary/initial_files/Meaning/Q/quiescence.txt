[36m         LONG  The noun quiescence looks similar to the word "quiet" for a good reason: quiescence is a quiet spell or state. It's used often to mean "dormancy," or the
               quieting of a symptom or a disease, such as the quiescence of a child's asthma symptoms during the winter months. The Latin root word is quies,
               which means "rest or quiet."[0m
