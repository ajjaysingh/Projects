[91m        SHORT  Your mother has probably more than once asked you for quietude even if she hasn't used the word. Quietude means a state of peace and quiet. It goes hand in
               hand with solitude.[0m
[36m         LONG  Quietude is a word that is used less and less, as we seem to have less time and space for it. A park used to be a good place to find quietude, but with cell
               phones, you're likely to begin chatting even when no one else is around. If you really want quietude, you might try a library, or a chapel.
               Meditation can be used to bring you a moment of quietude wherever you are. Try it now. Ohhhmmm. Ohhhmmm. Ohhhmmm.[0m
