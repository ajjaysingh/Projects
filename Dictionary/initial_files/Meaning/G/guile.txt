[91m        SHORT  Use the noun guile for cunning, craftiness, and artful duplicity. Acting like you have a job on Wall Street when you're actually unemployed would take a lot
               of guile.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun guile has quite negative connotations, as it refers to the kind of knowledge and skill that can be used by comic book villains for evil and not good!
               People who have guile are also thought of as being wily (which is also a related word), sneaky, and deceitful. Those who are free of guile are
               pure and upstanding, and Henry David Thoreau affirms those feelings when he wrote: "It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no
               guile!"[0m
