[91m        SHORT  Another word for a club, group, or society is guild, meaning a group of people who have joined together in pursuit of a common interest. Many fraternal and
               theatrical organizations still maintain buildings called guild halls for meetings and activities.[0m
[36m         LONG  The earliest guilds were for religious purposes as burial societies and offering financial support.  In the later Middle Ages, they became organizations to
               support various trades and crafts. As the forerunners of modern unions, they provided support for their members and were charged with assuring
               quality in each member's products. The word guild comes originally from the Scandinavian, with roots that mean "payment of tribute," similar to
               the German gelt ("money"), possibly to reflect the dues paid by members.[0m
