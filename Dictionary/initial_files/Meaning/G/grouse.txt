[91m        SHORT  A grouse is a small game bird. But the verb to grouse is different. It means to gripe about how unhappy you are. It's not recommended for most people, because
               grousing is unattractive.[0m
[36m         LONG  People's excitement about the rise of the Internet has been largely replaced by disappointment that it's turned out to be essentially a forum for people to
               grouse. No disappointment is too small to grouse about on the Internet. Did you stub your toe? Grouse about it in your blog! Did your sister
               tattletale? Get online and start grousing. "I grouse, therefore I am," might be the motto of the Internet. Oh well: now I'm grousing too.[0m
