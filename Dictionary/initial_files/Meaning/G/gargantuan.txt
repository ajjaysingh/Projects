[91m        SHORT  Whether you're talking about your gargantuan appetite or a gargantuan building, use the word gargantuan to describe something so big that big just isn't,
               well, big enough to accurately describe it.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word gargantuan can refer to an object that's physically massive in size or it can describe something that you perceive, like a feeling or an expectation.
               For example, you might have a gargantuan misunderstanding with your best friend. The word gargantuan came into English in the 16th century from
               Gargantua, a character in a series of French novels by the author Francois Rabelais. The books followed the adventures of two giants who were
               father and son.[0m
