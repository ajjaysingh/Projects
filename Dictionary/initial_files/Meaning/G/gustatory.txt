[91m        SHORT  If you want to improve the gustatory appeal of a grapefruit, you might add a spoonful of sugar. Gustatory is an adjective that refers to tasting or the sense
               of taste.[0m
[36m         LONG  You may be tempted to link gustatory with the word gust, meaning "a quick, strong rush of wind." However, gustatory has its roots in the Latin gustare,
               meaning "to taste," while gust can be traced back to the Old Norse gustr, meaning to "to gush." But if a gust of wind brings with it the
               savory aroma of a nearby backyard barbecue, you might find yourself licking the air in gustatory frustration.[0m
