[91m        SHORT  Guise, a noun, is the art of pretending to be something you aren't, like when, in the guise of an invited guest, you fake your way into the party of the
               century.[0m
[36m         LONG  No doubt you‚Äôve noticed the similarity between guise and disguise. Both involve the art of deception: it‚Äôs the methods that differ. Guise is about trying on
               new attitudes and mannerisms, such as speaking and acting in the guise of a native in a place where you are actually a tourist. Disguise
               involves hiding your real identity, disappearing in the new role.[0m
