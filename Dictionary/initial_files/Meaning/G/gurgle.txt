[91m        SHORT  To gurgle is to make a sound like bubbling or splashing water. Not to be confusing, but when you gargle mouthwash, you probably gurgle.[0m
[36m         LONG  People gurgle when they say something (or make a noise) with an accompanying wet, gurgling sound. Your stomach might gurgle too, especially when you're
               hungry. And liquid itself gurgles, like a stream that gurgles over rocks or sweet iced tea that gurgles from a bottle into your glass. Experts
               aren't sure if gurgle is an imitative word, from the sound itself, or if it's rooted in Latin.[0m
