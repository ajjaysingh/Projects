[91m        SHORT  A grievance is a complaint.  It can be formal, as when an employee files a grievance because of unsafe working conditions, or more of an emotional matter,

               filed against a person who builds a fence in his front yard in a town that does not allow that. If that same neighbor plants flowers he knows
               make you sneeze uncontrollably, you might be unhappy about that, but this is the kind of grievance you can work out among yourselves.[0m
