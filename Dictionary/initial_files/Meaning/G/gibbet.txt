[91m        SHORT  A gibbet is a structure that's used to execute criminals by hanging them. The execution of someone on a gibbet is an old-fashioned practice.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use the word gibbet to mean "gallows," or "public execution structure," and it can also be a verb, meaning to hang a person on one. Back in the days
               when executioners would routinely gibbet criminals in the public square, the bodies were often left on display ‚Äî possibly to intimidate other
               potential criminals. The word gibbet has its root in the Old French gibet, "bent stick or gallows," from gibe, or "club."[0m
