[36m         LONG  Water can gush out of a hose or a drinking fountain, and you can also call the jet of water itself a gush. A more figurative way to gush is to talk
               enthusiastically about something â€” you might gush when you're describing your favorite teacher. Gush comes from the twelfth century English
               word gosshien, originally "make noises in the stomach," and later "pour out." Gush is an onomatopoeic word â€” it sounds like what it means.[0m
