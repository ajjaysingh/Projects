[91m        SHORT  When your friend suggests a restaurant but you‚Äôre in a bad mood so you say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a stupid restaurant‚Äù ‚Äî even though you don‚Äôt really mind it ‚Äî then you‚Äôre
               being grumpy, meaning irritable or grouchy.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are all kinds of reasons for feeling grumpy: maybe you‚Äôre tired or annoyed or you have a headache. Whatever the cause, when you‚Äôre grumpy you just want
               to sulk in a corner. Even though it‚Äôs a negative word, it‚Äôs a pretty gentle one. When you're grumpy, you‚Äôre not mad or mean ‚Äî you‚Äôre just
               unpleasant for the moment. But don‚Äôt tell someone who‚Äôs grumpy that he's being grumpy . . .  He likely won‚Äôt respond kindly to that.[0m
