[91m        SHORT  A grid is a network of intersecting parallel lines, whether real or imaginary. Most American streets are laid out in a grid pattern, meaning the streets
               intersect at right angles and form a pattern of squares when viewed from above.[0m
[36m         LONG  You've probably seen a map grid, the uniform lines drawn on a map that allow you to pinpoint a particular location. Grid can also refer to a physical network
               of sorts, not necessarily made of straight or parallel lines. You may be familiar with the high voltage electrical cables that carry power
               throughout the country, known as the national grid. A gird can also be a device made up of intersecting metal bars that you use when grilling
               food.[0m
