[91m        SHORT  A lid is a top, or a cap — some kind of removable or hinged cover for a container. If you forget to put the lid on your tin of cat food, you may discover that
               your cat and dog have eaten it all by the end of the day.[0m

               moves over your eyeball like a lid: "Her heavy lids told me she didn't sleep at all." A lid is also slang for a hat or a helmet, and if someone
               says, "Put a lid on it," they're telling you (somewhat rudely) to quiet down.[0m
