[91m        SHORT  See lull, think "calm." It could be the noun form (like "the lull before the storm") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them (as in lulling a baby
               to sleep with a lullaby).[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun lull is often used in relation to a storm, but the term has a broader meaning as well. Lull can be used to describe any temporary period of calm or
               diminished activity, like the quiet time before the lunch rush in a restaurant or the brief period of tranquility before the doors open for a
               pre-Christmas sale. The word's verb form means "to soothe or to make someone feel relaxed." When used as a verb lull can turn deceptive, and it
               is often used to convey a false sense of security.[0m
