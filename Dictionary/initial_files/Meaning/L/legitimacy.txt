[91m        SHORT  The noun legitimacy means authenticity. If you found an old copy of the Gettysburg Address in your grandmother's attic, you'd have to question its legitimacy
               when you realized it was written on the back of a car advertisement.[0m
[36m         LONG  Legitimacy comes from the Latin verb legitimare, which means lawful. Legitimacy, then, refers to something that is legal because it meets the specific
               requirements of the law. The legitimacy of various countries' presidential elections is often discussed, with monitors keeping track of the
               voting procedures to make sure they follow all the necessary rules.[0m
