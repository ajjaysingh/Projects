[36m         LONG  You can physically lose something by misplacing it, or you can lose your pride in a competition. You can lose a game, you can lose your library book, you can
               lose money, you can lose your business, you can lose sight of your child, you can even lose your mind ‚Äî basically, you can lose just about
               anything. Losing something is usually not a good thing, unless it's that annoying boyfriend or weight.[0m
