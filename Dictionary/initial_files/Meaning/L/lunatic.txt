[91m        SHORT  A lunatic is someone who is either clinically insane or just acting really crazy. Someone driving too fast and zigging in and out of traffic is driving like a
               lunatic.[0m
[36m         LONG  The root of this word is luna, which means moon. That's because lunatic originally meant someone who went crazy with every phase of the moon, kind of like a
               werewolf. Most people these days don't believe in moon-caused insanity, but we still talk about lunatics, sometimes meaning clinically insane
               people. More often this is a slang term, used mainly in exaggerations, for anyone who seems wild and out of control.[0m
