[91m        SHORT  To litigate is to engage in some sort of legal proceedings. Litigating mostly takes place in court.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you're litigating, you'd better have a lawyer: you're involved in some sort of legal situation. When you sue someone, that's litigating. The person sued is
               also forced to litigate. People accused of a crime have to litigate when they're on trial. There are many types of litigation. Lawyers usually
               specialize in one type of litigating, such as criminal law or corporate law. If you're ever on a jury, you'll get a closer look at how
               litigating works.[0m
