[91m        SHORT  To legislate is to make laws. If you thought there should be a law that all money should be pink instead of green, you might write to your congresswoman with

               communication regulations during meals. Legislate may seem like a tricky word, but you can easily remember the meaning if you notice that the
               word begins with the same leg as the word legal does; both words relate to the law.[0m
