[91m        SHORT  A lodge is an inn where travelers stay overnight. If you‚Äôre in need of a night‚Äôs sleep while traveling an out of the way country road, you‚Äôre more likely to
               find yourself at a lodge than a fancy or chain hotel.[0m
[36m         LONG  A lodge can also be a cabin in the woods; like an inn, it‚Äôs usually a temporary accommodation. But if you join your local lodge, you‚Äôll be expected to be a
               regular visitor, at least at the monthly the meetings. Lodge is also a verb, meaning to stay temporarily, or to give someone a place to stay.
               If you lodge a toothpick between your teeth, though, you‚Äôll probably hope it won‚Äôt stay there too long.[0m
