[91m        SHORT  When you lob something, you throw it up very high. If you lob a baseball from the outfield to the pitcher, you hurl it in an arc that ends right where the
               pitcher can catch it.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you propel an object in an arc, you lob it ‚Äî a soldier might lob a missile at the enemy, and a protester might lob a rock at a crowd. Tennis players can
               lob a ball by hitting it up and over the net. Today the noun lob means a throw (or hit) that follows an arc, but in the 14th century a lob was
               a "lazy lout," and in the 16th century it was "a lumpish thing."[0m
