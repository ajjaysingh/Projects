[91m        SHORT  Someone who is a libertarian advocates the importance of the individual over government control — libertarians believe strongly in freedom.[0m
[36m         LONG  A libertarian holds onto the idea of a person's free will and individualism, with the word based on the Latin root liber, meaning “free.” In the U.S.,
               libertarians can be to the left or the right of the political spectrum. A libertarian believes that someone should make his or her own
               decisions rather than rely on a political party line. If you think the government should keep its nose out of your business, then you might be
               a libertarian.[0m
