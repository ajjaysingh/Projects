[91m        SHORT  If you like your new shoes, you are glad you bought them. If you are like your mother, you are similar to her in more ways than you probably want to admit.[0m
[36m         LONG  The meaning of like has to do with being similar: maybe you sound just like your sister when you answer the phone. Or, in giving an example, like is the go-to
               word to introduce it: "We enjoy sports like hockey." Like also can mean "enjoy" or "favor." We can see this in the word's origin, the Old
               English lician, meaning “be pleasing.” The speech pattern of saying "like" incessantly doesn't, like, mean anything.[0m
