[91m        SHORT  Ocular things have something to do with eyes or seeing. If you have what your doctor describes as "ocular pain," it means your eye hurts.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word ocular is a medical term meaning "of the eye." An ocular nerve connects to the eye, and an ocular specialist is an eye doctor. If you get an ocular
               exam, you'll have your vision tested or your eyes examined. If you get ocular damage from a stray baseball, you've got a hurt eyeball. Ocular
               comes from a Latin root, oculus, "an eye."[0m
