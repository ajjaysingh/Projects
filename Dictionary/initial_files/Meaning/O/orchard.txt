[36m         LONG  From the Old English orceard blossomed our modern-day spelling of orchard, a noun meaning “fruit farm.” But you can also use the word figuratively to refer to
               something filled with treats or precious content. The US Congregational minister, Henry Ward Beecher, was famous for having proclaimed, “A book
               is a garden, an orchard, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of counselors.”[0m
