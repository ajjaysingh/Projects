[91m        SHORT  Opulent is a word that you will hear a lot around rich people looking to show off. "Remember the opulent buffet at Carrie‚Äôs sweet sixteen? Sixteen chocolate
               cakes iced in gold leaf!"[0m

               gem. And if you are lucky enough to be able to afford opulence yourself, don‚Äôt describe it that way. The word contains connotations of
               pretentious. And gold leaf cake aside, who wants that?[0m
