[91m        SHORT  If something looks or sounds ominous, be careful: a threat or an unpleasant event is at hand. If you see an ominous frown on your boss's face, you're in

[36m         LONG  Ominous, and the related word omen both come from the 16th century Latin word ≈çmen "foreboding." However, unlike omen, which is a sign of something good or
               bad to come, ominous always describes something unpleasant or threatening. If the future looks ominous, you've got nothing to look forward to.
               Figuratively, an ominous sky or ominous clouds promise rain or a storm.[0m
