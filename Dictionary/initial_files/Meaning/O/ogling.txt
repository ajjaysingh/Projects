[91m        SHORT  When you ogle someone, you look at them with love or desire in mind. And if you're a cartoon character, you might also be drooling.[0m
[36m         LONG  Though it's most often used to refer to the way people gaze at each other, the verb ogle can also be used when talking about any object of desire â€” like when
               you ogle those designer jeans or that red Ferrari. The word comes from the 1680s German word oeglen, meaning "look at." Men are known to ogle
               women much more frequently than women ogle men. Ever seen a scene in a movie where a pretty lady walks into a bar and all the men turn on their
               bar stools to watch her pass by? That's classic ogling.[0m
