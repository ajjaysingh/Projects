               obsequious.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are many words in the English language for a person or an action that is overly obedient and submissive. Obsequious people are usually not being
               genuine; they resort to flattery and other fawning ways to stay in the good graces of authority figures. An obsequious person can be called a
               bootlicker, a brownnoser or a toady. You can also say that someone gives an obsequious bow, a gesture that means, "your wish is my command."[0m
