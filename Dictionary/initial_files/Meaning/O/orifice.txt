[36m         LONG  We most often use orifice to describe a natural opening in our bodies, but it can an opening into any cavity, such as a hollowed out tree trunk, or the vent
               of a heating system. Other definitions of orifice include a type of nozzle used in plumbing applications and a plate used to measure the flow
               of liquid.[0m
