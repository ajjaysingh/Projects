[91m        SHORT  Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say ‚Äî well, "flashy" or "showy."[0m
[36m         LONG  No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant, and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare,
               "to display," but in English it's often used for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an
               ostentatious display of "bling," and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant acquaintance might be making an ostentatious
               show of sorrow.[0m
