[91m        SHORT  If you have an obsession, you're totally fixated on something and unhealthily devoted to it. Some common obsessions include fantasy football leagues,

               it makes them anxious or emotionally unstable. If you have an obsession with the Yankees, for example, you might go to every single game, skip
               work to watch spring training, paper your room with Yankees posters, and write love notes to Derek Jeter.[0m
