	Wiki Definition:
              	" Orientalism ‚Äù is a way of seeing that imagines, emphasizes, exaggerates and distorts differences of Arab peoples and cultures as compared to that of Europe
               and the U.S. It often involves seeing Arab culture as exotic, backward, uncivilized, and at times dangerous.
