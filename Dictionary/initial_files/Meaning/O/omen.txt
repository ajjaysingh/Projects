[91m        SHORT  An omen is an event or happening that you take as sign of something to come. It‚Äôs believed to be a bad omen if a black cat crosses your path or if it rains on
               your wedding day.[0m
[36m         LONG  Omens generally get a bad rap ‚Äî that's probably because a lot of them predict bad stuff, at least according to superstition. But the interpretation of omens
               really depends on the country and culture. What's considered an ominous sign in one place might mean a lifetime of good luck somewhere else.
               Oscar Wilde once wrote that, ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.‚Äù[0m
