[36m         LONG  Whenever you have something to say about a subject, you have the option to opine about it or keep your mouth shut. Movie critics opine about the best films of
               the year, and kindergarten kids opine that they'd rather not take a nap. Opine can also describe what you suppose will happen, like when you
