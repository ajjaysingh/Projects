[91m        SHORT  Adequacy is the state of being sufficient for the purpose concerned. The meaning doesn't suggest abundance or excellence, or even more than what is absolutely
               necessary. Adequacy is simply the state of sufficiency.[0m
[36m         LONG  There is a current of equality running through the noun adequacy. The Latin word from which it is derived is adaequāre, "to make something equal to something
               else." The English word made its appearance in the early 1800s as a derivative of the adjective adequate. Adequacy means being equal to the
               requirements of the situation — no more, no less. Theater critic Walter Kerr once wrote this scathing review of an actor: "He has delusions of
               adequacy."[0m
