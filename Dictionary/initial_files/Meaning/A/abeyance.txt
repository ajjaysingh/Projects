[91m        SHORT  An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on "temporary." It is usually used with the word "in" or "into"; "in abeyance" suggests a
               state of waiting or holding.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason ‚Äî appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a
               legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property
               rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved.[0m
