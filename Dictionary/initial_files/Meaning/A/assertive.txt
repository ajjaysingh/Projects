[91m        SHORT  If you are upfront about what you want and bold in devising a plan that helps you get it, you could be described as assertive, meaning you act with authority
               and confidence.[0m
[36m         LONG  English offers many ways to describe getting what you want ‚Äî demanding, insistent, and pushy are a few of them. People who are assertive aren't as aggressive
               as those who are demanding and pushy, and they can negotiate a little better than those who are insistent. Use assertive to describe someone
               who is self-confident enough to make bold statements and forceful actions. The word can also be applied to nonhuman things, like policies and
               strategies.[0m
