[91m        SHORT  Use the noun anarchy to describe a complete lack of government ‚Äî or the chaotic state of affairs created by such an absence. A substitute teacher might worry
               that an unruly classroom will descend into anarchy.[0m
[36m         LONG  From the Greek for "without a ruler" we get this word for the political philosophy that the best government is no government at all ‚Äî a movement that enjoyed
               surprising success worldwide in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. Today, the word is more commonly used to describe not a
               political ideal but a state of total disorder, chaos and even violence: "A type of bloody anarchy is beginning to reign." A good synonym would
               be "lawlessness."[0m
