[91m        SHORT  Abominable is as bad as it gets. So if the food at camp is abominable, the campers might start to shout, "Ick! Ick! Your stew is making us sick!"[0m
[36m         LONG  Abominable is an adjective that should be used only when something is exceptionally bad or threatening, like a gigantic furry snowman who is terrorizing a
               village. Abominable is so absolutely awful that it causes physical revulsion. So odious that it brings even the toughest of tough guys to
               tears. Which is a bummer, because it's a surprisingly fun word to say out loud.[0m
