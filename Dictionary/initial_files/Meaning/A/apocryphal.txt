[91m        SHORT  Urban legends ‚Äî stories about phantom hitchhikers, deep-fried rats, and spider eggs in bubblegum ‚Äî are classic examples of apocryphal tales. They're told as
               if they're true, but no one can ever identify their origins.[0m
[36m         LONG  Today, any dubious or unverifiable story may be dismissed as apocryphal. If it can't be verified, it is seen as not real, true or authentic. Originally,
               however, apocryphal was reserved for religious writings that were not included in the Torah or the New Testament of the Bible because the
               divinity of the texts was not certain. These texts are known as the Apocrypha and are included in the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Hebrew
               Bible) and the Vulgate (a Latin Bible edited in the 4th century).[0m
