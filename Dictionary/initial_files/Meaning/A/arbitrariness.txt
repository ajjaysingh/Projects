[91m        SHORT  If you get detention Monday for not eating peaches, Tuesday for not wearing a top hat, and Wednesday for not walking backward, you might complain about the

[36m         LONG  We often associate arbitrariness with dictators who make up laws and dish out punishments based on their moods or their desperate attempts to stay in power.
               At the same time, parents demonstrate a kind of arbitrariness when they answer the question "why not?" with "Because I said so!" To avoid
               arbitrariness, people make decisions based on consistency, reason, order, and predictability.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Arbitrariness  is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".  Arbitrary  decisions are not
               necessarily the same as random decisions.
