[36m         LONG  If you've ever studied French you know that droit means "right," both as in "right of free speech" and as in "left and right," and à droit means both "turn
               right" and "properly." Once English people borrowed à droit, they changed the meaning slightly, from doing something "properly" to "doing
               something well." You may have heard the expression "surprisingly adroit," as in, "For a guy whose wife does all the cooking, he is surprisingly
               adroit in the kitchen."[0m
