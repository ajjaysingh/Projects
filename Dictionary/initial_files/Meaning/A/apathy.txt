[91m        SHORT  Use the noun apathy when someone isn't interested in the important things that are happening. You might feel apathy for the political process after watching
               candidates bicker tediously with one another.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although apathy is a lazy-sounding word indicating a lack of interest, action, or emotion, it has traveled through many languages to arrive in English. From
               the Greek apatheia, "freedom from suffering" or "impassibility," apathy has existed in English since the 17th century. Not just one person, but
               a whole segment of the population can be accused of inaction or emotional detachment: the expressions voter apathy, student apathy, and
               consumer apathy show just how unenthusiastic groups of people can be.[0m
