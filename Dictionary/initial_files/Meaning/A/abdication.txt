[91m        SHORT  Abdication is the formal act of stepping down from something, especially a king giving up the throne. An abdication is a type of resignation.[0m
[36m         LONG  When a king ‚Äî or another person in power ‚Äî gives up that position, they abdicate. Such an act is then called an abdication. The roots of this word mean
               declare in Latin, and that's an important part of the meaning. Abdicating isn't just quitting: it's formally quitting, including a declaration
               of quitting. There‚Äôs no such thing as a private abdication. After an abdication, there's a vacuum of power, and there may be a power struggle
               to fill the empty position.[0m
