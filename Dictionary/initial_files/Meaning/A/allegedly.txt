[36m         LONG  Allegedly is used almost entirely in a legal sense, referring to a potentially criminal action that is being or will shortly be decided in court. (It's from
               the medieval English word allege, meaning "quoted" or "brought forth in court.") For less serious matters, such as whether or not your
               boyfriend called you a liar, the word supposedly is generally used. Though watch out, because if you take him to court, you will become
               "allegedly a liar."[0m
