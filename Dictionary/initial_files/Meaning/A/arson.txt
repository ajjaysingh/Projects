[91m        SHORT  If you deliberately light logs on fire to roast marshmallows, you have camping skills. If you deliberately set your whole house on fire to collect the
               insurance money, you've committed arson.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun arson comes from the Latin word ardere, meaning "to burn." Arson is the act of setting something on fire for a nefarious purpose, and it is, of
               course, illegal. If you live in a wildfire risk area, you know that sometimes wildfires are caused by natural causes like lightening, sometimes
               they're caused accidentally by carelessness, and sadly they're sometimes caused by a deliberate act of arson.[0m
