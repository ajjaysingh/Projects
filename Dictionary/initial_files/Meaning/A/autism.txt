[91m        SHORT  Autism is a neurological condition that's marked by differences in learning styles, passionate interests in specific subjects, repetitive motion, and

[36m         LONG  The word autism is taken directly from the Greek root auto, meaning ‚Äúself.‚Äù Because autistic people may display a wide variety of characteristics, autism is
               defined as a range of conditions, known as the autism spectrum. This spectrum varies from those who have a hard time with social interaction to
               people who aren't able to speak. In some cases, autism is a diagnosis given by a doctor, while in others it's embraced by a person who self-
               identifies as autistic. A person who has autism is described as autistic.[0m
