[91m        SHORT  Altercation is a nicer word for "quarrel," which is a nicer word for "fight."[0m
[36m         LONG  Fight is a simple, effective one-syllable word, while quarrel is a softer, two-syllable word, and altercation is a very civilized-sounding four-syllable word for the same uncivilized
               thing: a noisy argument between people that are mad at each other. Two cowboys fighting in a saloon probably won‚Äôt talk about their altercation, but someone who gets a
               black eye fighting for a parking spot might ‚Äî after cooling down ‚Äî describe the incident as an altercation rather than as a knock-down, drag-out brawl.[0m
