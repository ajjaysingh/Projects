[36m         LONG  The noun advocacy comes to English from a term used in Roman law. An advocate was a professional whose job was to plead cases in front of a court of law.
               That meaning led to the verb form advocate, as well as advocacy, to describe the work of an advocate. "The lunchroom staff were advocates for
               healthier school lunches; their advocacy was supported by parents and the school board; however, the students were reluctant to give up their
               cookies and chips."[0m
