[91m        SHORT  After a long court trial, the judge reviews all the evidence to come to a conclusion about a case and that process is called adjudication.[0m
[36m         LONG  Adjudication comes from the Old French ajugier meaning "to judge, pass judgment on." An adjudication results in a formal judgment or decision given by a
               court.  Often these adjudications lead to the making of history, like the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka trial in which the process of
               adjudication resulted in a decision that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students
               unconstitutional.[0m
