[91m        SHORT  To apprise someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be
               the first one to be apprised of that event![0m
[36m         LONG  Don't confused the verbs apprise and appraise. Appraise means to determine the value of something â€” either its quality or its monetary worth. Apprise, on the
               other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you
               will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans.[0m
