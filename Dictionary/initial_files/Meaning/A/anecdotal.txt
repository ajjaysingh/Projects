[36m         LONG  People like to share stories about things that happened to them, or that they heard about, to make a point. That kind of talk is anecdotal: based on small,
               personal accounts. Anecdotal stories are helpful when you‚Äôre trying to give an example of something, but there's a downside to anecdotal
               information: since it‚Äôs not based on facts, you never know if you can totally trust it. So it's best to go beyond the anecdotal and get more
               solid information.[0m
