[91m        SHORT  Your abode is where you live. The Queen of England's abode may be far from humble, but it's the home where she rests her weary crown at the end of each day.[0m
[36m         LONG  Though it is often humble, as in, "Welcome to our humble abode," an abode is just a formal way of describing your home. A British solicitor (lawyer) would
               also use the word abode to describe his office, and if he worked from his home the word would cover both his work and his residence.
               Interestingly, if you were to substitute the o in the middle of the word for a c, you'd have the first five letters of the alphabet ‚Äî abcde.[0m
