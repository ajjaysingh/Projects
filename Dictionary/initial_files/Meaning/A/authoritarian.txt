[91m        SHORT  If your teacher orders you to detention every time you show up to class with a dull pencil, you could probably describe her as an authoritarian — a ruler who
               prefers order to freedom.[0m
[36m         LONG  Authoritarian and authority both begin with author, which comes from an ancient Latin word meaning "master," "teacher," or "leader."    The connection between
               authoritarian and master is obvious enough, and you can think of an author as the master of the fictional world she creates. Authoritarian is
               also an adjective.  That teacher with the rule against dull pencils?  You can use the noun form to say that she's an authoritarian, or you can
               use an adjective and skip the "an": "She's authoritarian."[0m
