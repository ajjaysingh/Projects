[91m        SHORT  Should you ever decide to form a club for anarchists, you might want to keep this in mind: Running for club president will make you unpopular, since

[36m         LONG  When the Sex Pistols released "Anarchy in the UK" in 1976, they clashed with Margaret Thatcher's ideal of conservative England. Translated from the Greek, by
               way of Middle Latin, anarchy means "without a leader," and that's what an anarchist is all about. Given that anarchists reject authority, it's
               not surprising that there are many types of anarchism, ranging from those that promote the perfect liberty of the individual to those that
               endorse communist or socialist ideas.[0m
