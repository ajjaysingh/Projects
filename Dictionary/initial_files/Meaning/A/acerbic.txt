[91m        SHORT  If you say something acerbic, or harshly bitter, to someone, it can leave a bitter taste in your own mouth that lingers, and the acerbic, or acidic, words can
               eat away at the person on the receiving end too.[0m
[36m         LONG  It is fitting that the first part of acerbic sounds like the first part of "acid," because the Latin source of acerbic is acerbus, "sour-tasting." Acerbic
               speech is like acid, because it is sour and corrodes, or weakens, relationships. There are ways to use sharp words for humor, and some
               comedians are known for their "acerbic wit," but just as you would take safety precautions in using acid in a science lab, you should be
               cautious using acerbic in conversation.[0m
