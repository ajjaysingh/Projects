[91m        SHORT  An accent is a stress or emphasis on a particular part of something, usually a word. Pronounce the word "doofus" with the accent on the first syllable: DOO-
               fuss.[0m
[36m         LONG  Accent comes from the Latin accentus, which means "the intonation of singing." We use accent for different kinds of emphasis in speech. In some foreign
               languages, the mark above a letter is an accent that signals how to pronounce it. If you accent something, like the "t" on the end of your
               name, you highlight it. In music, an emphasized note is accented. A regional accent is the particular way that people from that place speak.[0m
