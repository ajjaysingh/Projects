[91m        SHORT  Your alibi is evidence that proves your innocence. If you were making cookies with your mom when someone raided your sister's piggy bank, your mom is your
               alibi, since she knows you were with her when the crime was committed.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun alibi is the same word as its Latin root, alibi, which means "excuse." When you provide an alibi, you are giving proof ‚Äî a certified excuse ‚Äî that
               you could not have committed a crime. Alibi is easy to confuse with alias, which means "an assumed, or false, name."[0m
