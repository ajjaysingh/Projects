[91m        SHORT  To abet is to help someone do something, usually something wrong. If you were the lookout while your older sister swiped cookies from the cookie jar, you

[36m         LONG  The verb abet can be used to generally mean encouragement, but people usually expect to see it in relation to some crime. "The singer was abetted by a pianist
               in her rendition of Silver Bells," for example, is a harmless construction. However, people more often expect abet in a sentence like this:
               "She was charged with aiding and abetting the burglar because she drove the getaway car." Abet comes from an Old French word abeter meaning "to
               bait."[0m
