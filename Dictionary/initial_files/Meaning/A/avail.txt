[91m        SHORT  To avail means to take advantage of an opportunity, the way you'd be crazy not to avail yourself of a chocolate milkshake on Free Milkshake Day at your local
               ice cream parlor.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sometimes avail is used to mean "help," and in that case it can be used in a sentence like "Nothing seemed to avail me, not even winning the lottery." More
               often though, avail shows up in the company of "oneself of," as in the sentence, "I hope you avail yourself of my advice, because I'm very
               wise." It might seem like a complicated way to use a verb, but it's one you should avail yourself of if you're hoping to impress someone.[0m
