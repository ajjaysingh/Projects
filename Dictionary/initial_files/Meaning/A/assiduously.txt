[91m        SHORT  Something done assiduously is done with care and dedication. If you assiduously count your lemonade stand earnings, you tally up the dimes and quarters very

               "busy, incessant, continual, or constant." The people who shelf books at your local library do so assiduously — they take great care to put the
               books exactly where they belong in the stacks so that others can find them.[0m
