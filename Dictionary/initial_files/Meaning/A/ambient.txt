[91m        SHORT  Ambient is an adjective used to describe an aspect of the environment that completely surrounds you, but in a mellow way, like ambient music played softly
               throughout a restaurant, or the ambient orange glow during a setting sun.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ambient describes some pervasive quality of the surrounding environment, like the ambient lighting in a movie theater, or the ambient temperature of a room.
               Most times when you‚Äôre hearing silence, you‚Äôre hearing some ambient noises too, like the hum of a refrigerator or the whistle of a breeze.
               Usually ambient describes a quiet or peaceful quality, but it can be aggressive too, like the ambient drone of war planes flying above that you
               can hear no matter where you hide.[0m
