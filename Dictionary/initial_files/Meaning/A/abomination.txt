[91m        SHORT  The noun abomination means a thing or action that is vile, vicious or terrible. For example, if you see a neighbor kick an old blind dog that's done nothing
               wrong, you might remark, "That kind of cruelty is an abomination!"[0m
[36m         LONG  The word abomination comes from the Old French word abominacion meaning "horror, repugnance, disgust." The word abomination can also be used to refer to a
               person or object you find utterly loathsome and repellent. If you look at someone else as an abomination, that means you are horrified by them,
               and barely even think they're human. If you hear a friend describing you as an abomination behind your back, you need to find a new buddy right
               away![0m
