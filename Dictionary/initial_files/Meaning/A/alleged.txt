[36m         LONG  When a fact is alleged, there is doubt about its accuracy. The word alleged is often used in connection with court cases, because the accused is innocent
               until proven guilty: an alleged robber is a suspected robber but has not been proven guilty of robbery.  Journalists often use alleged in news
               stories when someone‚Äôs guilt is suspected but not confirmed. Sometimes alleged means doubtful or dubious, as in "Who is this alleged expert?"[0m
