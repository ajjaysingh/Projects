[91m        SHORT  If your lifelong Republican-voting grandfather suddenly decides to register as a Democrat, some of his conservative friends may consider his change in
               politics to be apostasy, or rejecting what has been a strong belief and adopting a new one.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you abandon a set of beliefs, especially when they're religious beliefs, you can be accused of apostasy, which in some countries is actually illegal.
               It's taken seriously by many churches, since the rejection of a church's ideas can be seen as a criticism of the entire organization. Over
               time, the meaning of apostasy has grown to include non-religious examples, like your grandfather's political switch.[0m
