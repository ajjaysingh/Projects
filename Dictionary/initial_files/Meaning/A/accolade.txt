[91m        SHORT  A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow knighthood, it is a
               form of praise or an award.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to "embrace the neck," which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, accolade came
               to mean "award." A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy, an accolade of
               achievement, while a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does either of these types of
               accolade involve a sword.[0m
