[91m        SHORT  An acquaintance is someone you know a little about, but they‚Äôre not your best friend or anything.  Acquaintance is also having knowledge about something
               specific, like horror films or the farming techniques of Chinese peasants.[0m
[36m         LONG  The root of acquaintance is the Old French word acointier, a verb meaning ‚Äúmake known.‚Äù  Being the acquaintance of a person or topic means that you know
               something about it.  An acquaintance is less intimate than a friend, like a person in your class whose name you know, but that‚Äôs it.  When you
               ‚Äúmake the acquaintance of‚Äù someone, you meet them for the first time. If you know nothing about eggplants, you‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI have little
               acquaintance with eggplants.‚Äù[0m
