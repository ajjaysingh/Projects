[91m        SHORT  To adulate is to flatter someone.  A lot. Like, drop-on-your-knees-and-clasp-your-hands-and-say-"you-are-the-greatest-ever-to-walk-the-earth" a lot.[0m
[36m         LONG  The most interesting syllable in adulate is the ul-, which comes from ulos, a Latin word meaning "tail." The idea is that if you're heaping flattery on
               someone, you might as well be a dog wagging its tail, panting for a treat. Not that there's anything wrong with a little flattery.  Or dogs.[0m
