[91m        SHORT  An antagonist is someone who opposes someone else. In the book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," the antagonist is the Grinch, because he tries to make life
               miserable for every Who down in Whoville.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun antagonist shows up a lot when people are talking about books, plays, or movies to mean "the bad guy," but it can also be used to talk about a real
               person if she acts against someone else. An antagonist is always in opposition, but she isn't always bad or mean; your opponent on the tennis
               court, for example, could be called your antagonist, simply because it is her priority to beat you in your tennis game.[0m
