[36m         LONG  Abstinence is the opposite of indulgence. People who practice abstinence deny themselves something, often something they really want. Regardless of whether
               people are abstaining from food, alcohol, or sex, they have to practice self-control. In fact, the word is derived from the Latin term for "to
               hold back." The word abstinence is often used in reference to sex education courses that teach kids to hold themselves back from having sex.[0m
