[91m        SHORT  An android is a robot that looks and acts like a human being.  Sometimes they have fake skin that looks so real you can’t tell the difference.  For all you
               know, the person sitting next to you is an android.[0m
[36m         LONG  Life’s biggest question: What’s the difference between cyborgs and androids? Cyborgs are humans with robot parts added to them, and androids start as robots
               and then get designed to look like humans. The Latin root androides literally means “resembling a man,” and androids really know how to blend
               in.  Androids mostly appear in science fiction novels and films, but who knows, maybe you’re friends with an android and you don’t even know
               it.  Yet.[0m
