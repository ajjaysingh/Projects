[36m         LONG  Appendage often describes body parts, either on humans or animals. If it‚Äôs something that sticks out ‚Äî like a finger, tail, or leg ‚Äî chances are it can be
               called an appendage. The word can also be used figuratively to refer to something that‚Äôs associated with something larger or more important,
               like a husband who‚Äôs a mere appendage to his famous wife. In this sense, the word takes on a negative connotation: the appendage is not
               important.[0m
