[91m        SHORT  Apprehension is fear or anxiety about something – you might feel apprehension about an upcoming test. Apprehension is also the capture of a criminal, when

[36m         LONG  Given the crook's record of evading arrest, the chief had real apprehensions about being able to catch him. Eventually though, she activated the whole police

               crime in progress that the guy apprehended just how much trouble he was in. It was that apprehension that led him to make a deal with the
               district attorney.[0m
