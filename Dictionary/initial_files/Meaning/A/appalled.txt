[91m        SHORT  Appalled is an adjective that describes feeling shocked and disappointed. Being appalled happens suddenly, like when you find out your little sister has been
               blogging about your family, telling embarrassing stories.[0m
[36m         LONG  Appalled comes from the Latin word pallescere, meaning "to grow pale" ‚Äî the kind of shock that drains the color from your face. When you are appalled, you
               don't just disapprove of what you are seeing; you are emotionally disturbed by it, like being appalled by the wasted food at a cafeteria or
               restaurant or the rudeness of someone who lets the door slam in your face.[0m
