[91m        SHORT  If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ambivalent means "having mixed feelings about something." A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth
               century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning "both," with valentia, "strength." So
               etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things ‚Äî but in practice, ambivalence often arises from
               caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless
               tofu.[0m
