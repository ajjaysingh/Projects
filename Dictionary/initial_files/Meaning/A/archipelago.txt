[91m        SHORT  Now here's a word, archipelago, that is super-specific: it means a group of many islands. Wouldn't it be great to build your dream house in the Galapagos
               archipelago?[0m
[36m         LONG  It seems that archipelago came from the Italian Arciplago, the name for the Aegean Sea, which is full of many many islands. Somehow that became the word for
               any sea that is chock-full of islands. You can also use archipelago to indicate some other grouping that involves neither islands nor water but
               is similar to them. Your little sister might create an archipelago of Lego buildings on your living room carpet.[0m
