[91m        SHORT  An attribute is a quality or characteristic given to a person, group, or some other thing. Your best attribute might be your willingness to help others, like

[36m         LONG  Attribute comes from the Latin verb attribuere, which is made up the prefix ad, meaning "to," and tribuere meaning "give or bestow." As a verb, to attribute
               is to give credit, like if you attribute the A on your test to all that hard studying. In Greek and Roman mythology an attribute will often
               stand in for a character such as Zeus's lightning bolt or Poseidon's trident.[0m
