[91m        SHORT  An autocrat is another name for a dictator, someone who wields absolute power and uses it in a cruel and despotic manner.[0m
[36m         LONG  This is a word for cruel, oppressive dictators. Hitler and Stalin were historic autocrats. In more recent times, dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Qaddafi
               were autocrats. From autocrat, we get the word autocratic, for anyone behaving like a dictator. Unfortunately, through history, there have been
               many autocrats: leaders who didn't give their people a say in their regime and killed their enemies. You might call your boss, parent, or
               teacher an autocrat, but that's probably an exaggeration.[0m
