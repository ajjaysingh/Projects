[91m        SHORT  The noun agony means acute pain ‚Äî either mental or physical, but people often use the word hyperbolically: "This paper cut is agony."[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun agony is also used in the common phrase "the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat," which has been the tag-line of ABC's Wide World of Sports

               pain, but the physical pain, was nothing compared to his mental agony when the doctor setting the bone joked, 'Now you know the agony of de
               feet!'"[0m
