[91m        SHORT  An altar is a raised area in a house of worship where people can honor God with offerings. It is prominent in the Bible as "God's table," a sacred place for
               sacrifices and gifts offered up to God.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word altar comes from the Latin altƒÅrium, meaning "high," and also to the Latin adolere, which means "to ritually burn or sacrifice," which suggests its
               early purpose as detailed in the Bible. Nowadays, the altar is the place for non-sacrificial religious rites such as communion or weddings, and
               is a metaphor for offerings. Comedian Stephen Fry once said, ‚ÄúI am a lover of truth, a worshipper of freedom, a celebrant at the altar of
               language and purity and tolerance.‚Äù[0m
