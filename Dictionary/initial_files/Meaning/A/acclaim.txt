[91m        SHORT  You know you've hit it big when you earn acclaim, or enthusiastic approval. And when you have achieved "critical acclaim," even the grouchy critics approve of
               you.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word acclaim comes from the Latin word acclamare, which means to cry out. So it only makes sense that the verb acclaim means to offer enthusiastic praise
               or applause. "The book was critically acclaimed, but most of the students found it to be stupefyingly boring."[0m
