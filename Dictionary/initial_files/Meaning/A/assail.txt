[36m         LONG  Believe it or not, assail evolved from the ancient Latin word  assilire, which means "to jump on." So picture an attacker jumping on you, throwing punches and
               maybe some insults, too. Because assail also means to ridicule or heap your worries upon someone. As novelist Charlotte Bronte noted,
               ‚ÄúConventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.‚Äù Think on that.[0m
