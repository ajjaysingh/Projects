[91m        SHORT  The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic
               appeal.[0m
[36m         LONG  Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning "perception," comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense,
               it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has "aesthetic value," it has value as a work of art (even if
               nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an "aesthetic painting."[0m
