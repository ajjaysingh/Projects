[91m        SHORT  The verb accustom means to become used to or familiar with something; to make something a habit. If there is a new baby in your family, you will most likely
               become accustomed to changing diapers.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although the verb accustom looks like it should be related to the word custom, it actually comes through costume, through the Old French acostumer, with Ã ,
               meaning "to," and costume, meaning "fashion or habit." Now it retains the meaning to make something a habit. You can accustom yourself to loud
               sirens if you live in a city or to the sound of crickets if you live in the country. Parents often cannot become accustomed to the musical
               taste of their kids.[0m
