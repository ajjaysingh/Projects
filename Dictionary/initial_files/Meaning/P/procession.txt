[91m        SHORT  A procession of mimes walking through the streets of your town would be surprising and somewhat terrifying. A line or group of people moving together in a
               deliberate way is a procession.[0m
[36m         LONG  You're most likely to see a procession during some kind of ceremony, parade, or festival. A line of cars moving together to a cemetery is a funeral
               procession, and a bunch of parents pushing babies in strollers in a parade are also a procession. Another meaning of procession is any line or
               succession of people moving continuously, like a procession of local politicians knocking on your door one afternoon. The root of procession is
               the Latin processio, "marching forward."[0m
