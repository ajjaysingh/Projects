[91m        SHORT  To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class.[0m
[36m         LONG  Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is
               used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor‚Äôs orders, you could say you
               were confused about the meaning of these two words ‚Äî but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people‚Äôs value systems. And it would
               also be bad for your health.[0m
