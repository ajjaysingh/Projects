[91m        SHORT  Something that is poignant touches you deeply. Watching a poignant YouTube video about baby penguins chasing their mothers, for example, might give you a lump

[36m         LONG  Poignant comes from the Latin pungere "to prick," the same root as pungent. But something that's pungent pricks your sense of smell, whereas poignant refers
               to something that pricks your emotions, especially in a melancholy way. Movie critics might describe a touching portrayal as poignant if there
               isn't a dry eye in the house.[0m
