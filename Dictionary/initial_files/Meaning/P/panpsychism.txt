[91m        SHORT  If you're a proponent of anarchism, you believe in a political system that does away with all government.[0m
[36m         LONG  Someone who favors anarchism can be described as an anarchist, a person who places the most political importance on individual freedom, especially from
               powerful governments. Anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes hierarchies â€” systems in which one powerful person is in charge â€” and
               favors equality between all people. The Greek root word is anarkhia, "lack of a leader," or "the state of no government."[0m
