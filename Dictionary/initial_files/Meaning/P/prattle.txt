[91m        SHORT  If your little sister won't stop talking about her latest crush and you don't want to hear it, you might say, "Stop prattling on about that loser!" To prattle
               is go on and on about something unimportant.[0m
[36m         LONG  Prattle can also be a noun. If your sister tattles about your comment regarding her prattling, you could defend yourself to your mother with: "I didn't mean
               to call Sophie's crush a loser, but she had driven me mad with her constant prattle." There are a lot of funny-sounding words with a meaning
