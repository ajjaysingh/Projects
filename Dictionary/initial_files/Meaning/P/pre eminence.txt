[91m        SHORT  Preeminence is the quality of being superior. It‚Äôs a type of high status or distinction for anything considered to be the best at something, like the
               preeminence of gold or the preeminence of a famous musician.[0m
[36m         LONG  Preeminence (or pre-eminence if you love hyphens) comes from the Latin word praeeminere for to ‚Äúrise above or excel.‚Äù People with preeminence include the
               President, billionaires, and great athletes such as Michael Jordan. By definition, preeiminence suggests superiority, so it can't be a quality
               lots of people have. A world-famous surgeon is a doctor with preeminence. Anyone considered wealthy, powerful, important, or famous has
               preeminence.[0m
