[91m        SHORT  To penetrate is to force into or pierce through. If the fog is thick as pea soup, your flashlight won‚Äôt penetrate it. If you stubbornly ignore good advice,

[36m         LONG  We get penetrate from the Latin word penetrare, which combines penes ("within") and intrare ("to enter"). Penetrate crops up most often to describe entering
               or permeating. Blaring music penetrated every corner of the dorm and we wondered how anyone could study with that racket. Penetrate can also
               mean to decipher or understand: "Careful study allowed us to penetrate the mysteries of Pig Latin." Finally ‚Äî no surprise, given its Latin
               roots ‚Äî the word can be used to describe sexual intercourse.[0m
