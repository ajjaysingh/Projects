[36m         LONG  The first part of proprietor sounds a lot like "property," and a proprietor is someone with ownership of property. Sometimes a proprietor oversees the
               business, such as a restaurant proprietor who is also a chef or hostess, and other times a proprietor owns many businesses and has different
               people running them. A proprietor of a local bakery might make and sell his own donuts, while the proprietor of a chain of donut shops might
               work from an office managing the people who manage the stores.[0m
