[36m         LONG  When most people think of psychoanalysis they think of Sigmund Freud, who first developed it at the end of the 19th century. It's a type of psychotherapy that
               uses stories from childhood, dreams, free association, and other techniques to get at a person's subconscious, or the thoughts and fears hidden
               deep inside the mind. Psychoanalysis is sometimes described as "talk therapy." The word is rooted in the Greek psychē, or "soul."[0m
