[91m        SHORT  When something is done pro forma, it's done purely as a formality. When the person conducting a wedding ceremony asks if anyone has an objection to the
               marriage, just keep quiet. That question is strictly pro forma.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pro forma is a Latin term meaning ‚Äúas a matter of form‚Äù or ‚Äúfor the sake of form.‚Äù If you do something pro forma, you are probably not giving it much
               attention; you are just going through the motions. Pro forma actions are formalities, which means they don‚Äôt have much practical value, but
               they must be done because that‚Äôs how they‚Äôve always been done. A pro forma session of Congress has more to do with following the rules than
               with getting anything done.[0m
