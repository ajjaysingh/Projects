[91m        SHORT  If you're lacking the basic necessities of life ‚Äî food, water, political freedom, and so on ‚Äî you're suffering from privation.[0m
[36m         LONG  Privation has become a rather old-fashioned word, and when used now is often with irony: present day privations are usually of the order of not having
               wireless Internet or video games. It's interesting to compare privation with the similar word deprivation, which is used more commonly now.
               Deprivation usually suggests that someone or something has actually caused the privation.[0m
