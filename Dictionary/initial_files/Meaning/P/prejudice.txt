[91m        SHORT  If you have a negative attitude towards someone based on race or ethnicity rather than personal experience, you might be accused of prejudice.[0m
[36m         LONG  Prejudice is remarkably similar to its Latin root in form and meaning; the Latin praejudicium means "judgment in advance." A racial prejudice is a negative
               attitude towards a group of people based on race ‚Äî not on direct knowledge or experience. If you prejudice someone, you cause them to have a
               negative attitude towards someone else. Lawyers are not allowed to bring certain types of evidence such as rumors into a trial because it might
               prejudice the jury.[0m
