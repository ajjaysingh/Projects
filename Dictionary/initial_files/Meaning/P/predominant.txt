[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre talking about the most popular or common thing, call it predominant. If the predominant feeling in a neighborhood is that pizza is the best food,
               the result might be pizzerias being the predominant type of restaurant there.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective predominant describes a person or thing with great power or influence, or something that is prevalent. It comes from the Latin prefix prae-,
               ‚Äúbefore,‚Äù and dominari, ‚Äúto rule.‚Äù For example, because so many people like hip-hop, it might be the predominant music heard at a school dance.
               And that neighborhood with all the pizzerias? Teenagers are the predominant customers, and pepperoni is the predominant topping.[0m
