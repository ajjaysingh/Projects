[91m        SHORT  A patriarchy is a social system or organization run by men. If Dad always gets the last word in your house, then you're living under a patriarchy![0m
[36m         LONG  A patriarchy is a social or political system with one or several men in charge. It may refer to society at large or to one segment, such as the Catholic
               Church, with the Archbishop and Pope in positions of power. The word can also describe family systems, especially when relationships and
               property are determined by males. In modern times patriarchy is often considered to be oppressive to women; if you‚Äôre a feminist, then you‚Äôre
               definitely not a fan of patriarchy.[0m
