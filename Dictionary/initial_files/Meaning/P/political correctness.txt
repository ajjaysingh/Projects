[91m        SHORT  Political correctness is the practice of being careful not to offend or exclude anyone, especially people who belong to groups that are frequently
               discriminated against. Comedians who don't worry about political correctness sometimes get themselves in trouble.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the 1970s, political correctness was seen as a way to avoid hurting people's feelings or deeply insulting them, but the phrase soon took on an ironic or
               critical slant. Today, most people who use the term mean it as a criticism of being overly careful: "Saying 'fire fighter' instead of 'fireman'
               seems like political correctness that's gone too far to me." Conservatives in particular see political correctness as a liberal worldview
               imposed on every aspect of culture.[0m
