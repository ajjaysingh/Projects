[36m         LONG  Pedantic means "like a pedant," someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off
               book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the
               opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of Chinese porcelain kitty-litter boxes.[0m
