[91m        SHORT  The noun pedigree refers to the genetic background of an animal, although it is sometimes applied to people as well. A purebred dog, for example, comes with a
               verified pedigree, a list of all past parentage.[0m
[36m         LONG  The preoccupation with pedigree isn't new -‚Äî the concern for human pedigree can be seen in the Bible, where generations are meticulously recorded. Pedigree,
               referring to a genealogical chart, appeared in 1410 from the Anglo-French pe de gru, meaning "foot of a crane," referring to the chart‚Äôs tree ‚Äî
               like lines, which looked like the print of a crane's foot. The importance of pedigree extends to animals such as dogs and horses, with breeders
               careful to follow the animal's lines to assure "purity."[0m
