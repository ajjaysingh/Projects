[91m        SHORT  Pandemonium is chaos, total and utter craziness ‚Äî like the stampede after your team won the championship, when everyone spilled onto the field at once,

[36m         LONG  If you look carefully at the word pandemonium, you‚Äôll see the word demon inside it. This makes sense, since the word pandemonium was coined in Milton‚Äôs
               Paradise Lost, where it was the name of the palace built in the middle of Hell. Milton wrote back in the 17th century. Nowadays, pandemonium
               crops up whenever journalists are describing a chaotic scene. High school students have been heard to use it to describe their lunchroom.[0m
