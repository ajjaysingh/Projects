[91m        SHORT  Knowing that the adjective palatial is derived from the same Latin word as palace gives you a good sense of its meaning: magnificent, reminiscent of a home
               fit for a king.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Palatine (Collis Palatium in Latin) is the center of Rome‚Äôs famed Seven Hills. Tradition holds that it was the location on which Romulus founded the city,
               and it became a prestigious site for powerful Romans‚Äîincluding emperors‚Äîto build large, lavish homes. Palatium made its way into every Romance
               language and beyond: it became palazzo in Italian, palacio in Spanish, and palast in German. Palace entered English via the Old French palais.
               Power, affluence, extravagance: these are the qualities that should come to mind when you encounter the word palatial.[0m
