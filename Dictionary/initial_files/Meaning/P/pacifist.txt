[91m        SHORT  A person who opposes the use of war or violence to settle a dispute is called a pacifist. If you are a pacifist, you talk through your differences with others

[36m         LONG  A pacifist is a peacemaker ‚Äî even its Latin origins of pax, or "peace" and facere, "to make" show it. If you are a pacifist, you avoid physical
               confrontations. The beliefs and actions of peacemakers can also be described as pacifist, as in someone whose pacifist beliefs lead him to take
