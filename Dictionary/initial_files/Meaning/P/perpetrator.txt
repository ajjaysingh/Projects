[91m        SHORT  A perpetrator is someone who has committed a crime — or at least done something pretty bad. You've probably seen cops on TV trying to get a description of the
               perpetrator of a bank heist.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word perpetrator is so often associated with crime that police officers and other criminal justice types sometimes abbreviate it “perp.” A perpetrator is
               often a suspect until it has been proven that he or she carried out the offense. The word usually describes someone who's committed a crime,
               but any wrongdoing will do. If someone took Uncle Bob's cake and a trail of crumbs leads to your bedroom, your mom will know who the likely
               perpetrator is.[0m
