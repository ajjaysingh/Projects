[91m        SHORT  A parable is a short and simple story that teaches a religious or moral lesson. The parable of the Good Samaritan and the parable of the Prodigal Son are just
               two examples of the many parables attributed to Jesus, as recorded in the four gospels.[0m
[36m         LONG  Parable descends from the Greek parabolƒì "a comparison, analogy," from paraballein "to compare," from the prefix para- "beside" plus ballein "to throw." The
               sense of comparing, or throwing an idea beside another, is at the heart of the word. When you hear a parable, you're meant to use the
               comparison to learn how to act‚Äì‚Äìthe fox's "sour grapes" are compared to your own downgrading of the thing you cannot have.[0m
