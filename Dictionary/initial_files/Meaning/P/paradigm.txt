[36m         LONG  A paradigm is a new way of looking or thinking about something. This word comes up a lot in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in
               business could mean a new way of reaching customers and making money. In education, relying on lectures is a paradigm: if you suddenly shifted
               to all group work, that would be a new paradigm. When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something.[0m
