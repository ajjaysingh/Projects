[36m         LONG  The noun persecution is related to persecute, which comes from Latin persecut-, meaning “followed with hostility.” Persecution means hassling or singling out
               a person or group because of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or social status. In many schools, the persecution of
               students by bullies has resulted in a zero-tolerance policy for such despicable behavior.[0m
