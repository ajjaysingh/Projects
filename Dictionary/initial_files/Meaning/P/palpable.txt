[91m        SHORT  When something is palpable, you can touch or handle it, even though the word is often used to describe things that usually can't be handled or touched, such
               as emotions or sensations.[0m
[36m         LONG  You probably won't see palpable used to describe, say, an egg or a doorknob or a motorcycle. Palpable is usually reserved for situations in which something
               invisible becomes so intense that it feels as though it has substance or weight. When the towers came down, the sense of sadness was so great,
               it was palpable.[0m
