[91m        SHORT  Whether you're talking about your attitude, a gigantic diamond, or that obnoxious guy's claims that he knows everything about quantum physics, you can use
               phony to say that something‚Äôs not real.[0m
[36m         LONG  Use the adjective phony to describe anything that‚Äôs fake. If you‚Äôre making phony money in the basement, you‚Äôll be in trouble if you get caught using it. Phony
               has a noun version with a similar meaning. If you say someone or something is a phony, then you‚Äôre saying it isn‚Äôt what it pretends to be.
               Someone who‚Äôs a phony isn‚Äôt sincere, like your classmate who pretended to be your best friend just to try to steal your boyfriend.[0m
