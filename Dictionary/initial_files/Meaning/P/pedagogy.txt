[91m        SHORT  Pedagogy is another word for education, the profession and science of teaching.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pedagogy and pedagogue come from the Greek paidos "boy, child" plus agogos "leader." Pedagogy refers to the teaching profession as well as the science of
               education, for example as a college subject. This might be one reason that the word, pedagogue, is often used for a teacher who is overly
               interested in rules and details, hence the science of teaching, rather than actually getting through to his or her students.[0m
