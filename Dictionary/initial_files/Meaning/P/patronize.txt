[91m        SHORT  If you patronize a business, you shop there regularly. But if someone patronizes you, it's not so pleasant ‚Äî they talk to you as if you were inferior or not
               very intelligent.[0m
[36m         LONG  Patronize comes from Latin patronus "protector, master," related to pater "father." So if you patronize a person, you talk down to them like a father might
               do to his child or a master to his apprentice. If you want to take an advanced class and your advisor warns you of all the hard work, you can
               tell him to stop patronizing you ‚Äî you know a hard class involves hard work. This sounds much better than saying, "I'm not stupid!"[0m
