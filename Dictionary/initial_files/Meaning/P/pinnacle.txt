[91m        SHORT  Going as far into the sky as you can go on foot, you'll reach the highest point, or pinnacle, of the Himalayas. A successful climb like that might also become
               the pinnacle, or peak, of your success.[0m
[36m         LONG  Two synonyms for pinnacle also start with the letter "p," "peak" and "point." A pinnacle can be a physical thing, like the top of a high mountain or the
               antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a high point that can’t be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal. Whatever
               the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone the highest you can go. "Acme" is a great synonym
               for pinnacle.[0m
