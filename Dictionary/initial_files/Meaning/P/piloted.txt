[91m        SHORT  A pilot leads the way. An aircraft pilot flies a plane, and a maritime pilot steers a ship. Also, to pilot is to guide to safety, like to navigate a ship out
               of a harbor or through a sea of zombies.[0m
[36m         LONG  Pilot comes from the Greek pƒìdon meaning "oar." Like an oar that steers a ship, a pilot steers or directs a plane. A pilot can also be a model or basis for
               others of its kind. A school might launch a pilot breakfast program for a few students before introducing it to the whole school. The pilot
               episode of a TV show is like a test program produced to determine viewer interest before making a whole season.[0m
