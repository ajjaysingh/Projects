[36m         LONG  The noun pedantry refers to the behavior of a pedant, which comes from the French word p√©dant, meaning ‚Äúschoolmaster.‚Äù While it is a schoolmaster's job to
               ensure that students learn, someone who is guilty of pedantry just seems to brag, using his or her knowledge to get attention or seem better
               educated than the people around him or her.[0m
