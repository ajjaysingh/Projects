[36m         LONG  A peddler is someone who sells things, but it's a very specific type of selling. Peddlers ‚Äî also known as hawkers and pitchmen ‚Äî travel from town to town,
               especially with a carnival or circus. Peddlers are also found on the street, selling many different things, from jewelry to DVDs. There's a
               shady implication to this word, since peddlers have included people selling snake oil and other worthless products. Instead of buying from a
               peddler, you're probably better off at a store.[0m
