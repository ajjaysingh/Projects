[91m        SHORT  If something happens after someone dies, it is described as posthumous — like the posthumous interest in the music of a singer who died "a nobody."[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective posthumous comes from Latin — post means "after" and humare, "to bury." (You might also think of humus, which means "dirt" or "earth.") So
               something that is posthumous happens after a person is dead, like the posthumous discovery that your humble neighbor who lived very modestly
               was actually a multi-millionaire, or the posthumous publication of a book that the writer finished just before she died.[0m
