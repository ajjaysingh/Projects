[91m        SHORT  A plot is a scheme, a story, a map charting progress, or a piece of land (as for a garden). To plot is to devise the secret plan, order the events of the

[36m         LONG  You could make a whole movie based the word plot. This could be the plot (story): An evil so-and-so hatches a secret plot (scheme) to follow the explorer to a
               legendary plot (patch) of land with buried treasure. The explorer plots (draws) the best route to the treasure, but the evil so-and-so steals
               the plot (map) and gets to the treasure first. What a great story. All that's left is to plot (arrange) the sequence of events for maximum
               suspense.[0m
