[91m        SHORT  A proctor keeps an eye on students who are taking a test to make sure they don't cheat. The invention of the cell phone has certainly made proctors' lives
               tougher.[0m
[36m         LONG  For college entrance exams, students are often supervised by a professional proctor, while in less official situations, like a pop quiz, the proctor is
               usually the teacher herself. Proctor is both a noun and a verb, so you might say that a proctor's job is to proctor, or make sure no test-
               takers' eyes are straying. The Latin root word is procuratorem, which means "manager."[0m
