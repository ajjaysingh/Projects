[91m        SHORT  When something proliferates, it's growing, spreading or multiplying really quickly. Bunny rabbits have a habit of proliferating, as do dandelions in untended

[36m         LONG  Proliferate was originally a biological term used to describe the growth of cells and producing offspring. It wasn‚Äôt until 1961 that we started to use
               proliferate more generally to talk about everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the wide growth of Walmart. Other similar words
               include expand, reproduce, snowball, and spawn.[0m
