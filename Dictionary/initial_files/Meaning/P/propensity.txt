[91m        SHORT  A propensity is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all have propensities ‚Äî things we tend to do. Dogs have a propensity to bark, and many

[36m         LONG  If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to
               laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your
               propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.[0m
