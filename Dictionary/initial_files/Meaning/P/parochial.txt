[91m        SHORT  If an issue or a matter is parochial, it is trivial or only concerns a local area. Likewise, a person with a parochial mentality is narrow-minded, or not open
               to new ideas.[0m
[36m         LONG  Parochial comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning "of a parish." As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular
               church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, parochial refers to a narrow or limited point of view ‚Äî that is, an outlook that
               extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older
               generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age![0m
