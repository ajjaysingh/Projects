[91m        SHORT  If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don‚Äôt take the pill.  It‚Äôs a panacea, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Greek word pan means ‚Äúall‚Äù (think of a panorama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The Greek word for ‚Äúcure‚Äù is akƒìs (which looks like the word
               ‚Äúaches‚Äù).  Those are the roots of panacea, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn‚Äôt really cure everything; it just acts like it can.  Use
               the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you.[0m
