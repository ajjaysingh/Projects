[36m         LONG  A concert poster, a storefront notice, a protest sign carried in a rally тАФ each of these is a type of placard. A placard can be as impermanent as a square of
               cardboard with a scrawled message, and as official as a permanent plaque marking a historic building. The Old French word plaquier is at the
               root of placard, and it means "to plaster or to lay flat."[0m
