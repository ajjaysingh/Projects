[91m        SHORT  Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all day long are famous for their piety. If you have filial piety it means you're devoted to
               your parents.[0m
[36m         LONG  Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person is only pretending to be devoted or good.  Piety was borrowed from French piet√© "piety,
               pity," from Latin pietas, from pius "devoted, kind." This Latin adjective is the source of our English adjective pious.[0m
