[36m         LONG  First appearing around 1400, portable stems from the Latin word portare, meaning "to carry." Used as an adjective, portable describes something you can carry
               around easily. Used as a noun, it means a smaller, easy-to-carry version of something, like a computer or television. On a trip, you might take
               your portable so you can watch movies in the car. Before computers became popular, you might have carried around a lightweight typewriter
