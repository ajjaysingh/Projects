[91m        SHORT  Petty used to mean just "petite" or "small," but now it's used for things that are trivial and shouldn‚Äôt matter much. If you host world leaders and spend more
               time picking napkins than memorizing names, you're focused on petty things.[0m
[36m         LONG  A few neutral meanings of petty are still in use today ‚Äî such as "petty cash," which refers to a small amount of cash on hand ‚Äî but most uses of petty since
               the 16th century are negative, as in "narrow-minded," "trivial," and "of little importance." A "petty argument" is a popular expression,
               because many people get all worked up over something that isn't very important ‚Äî a petty concern ‚Äî that seems much smaller after the heat of
               the moment.[0m
