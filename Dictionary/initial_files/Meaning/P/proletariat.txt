[91m        SHORT  Proletariat is an old term for the working class. It was commonly used by Marxists and other people who believed that capitalism had created a class of
               workers who were exploited by company owners. They called those owners "the bourgeoisie."[0m
[36m         LONG  When you use the word proletariat now, your audience might assume that you've arrived in a time machine from the 19th century and you're still angry about
               the exploitation of workers. So you probably would use the term self-consciously or humorously, as in ‚ÄúThe boss just sent around a memo saying
               no one‚Äôs allowed to leave until we‚Äôve finished compiling the report. I guess the proletariat had better forget about making it home in time to
               watch the kick-off.‚Äù[0m
