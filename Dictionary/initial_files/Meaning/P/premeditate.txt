[91m        SHORT  When you premeditate, you are planning ahead. While most people associate this word with crime, let's hope you can think of a better reason to premeditate —
               like buying groceries before a storm.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you meditate, you think deeply. The prefix pre- means “before,” so to premeditate means to think about a situation before you’ve jumped into it. If
               you’ve ever cooked a meal, you’ve premeditated the ingredients you need to get started. In a courtroom you’ll hear about "premeditated murder,"
               which means the accused killer planned out his crime and it wasn’t a crime of passion. Premeditating can be a good thing, but not when it
               involves murder.[0m
