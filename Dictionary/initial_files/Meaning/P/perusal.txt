[91m        SHORT  Perusal is the activity of carefully reading, poring over, or studying something with the intent of remembering it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sometimes the word perusal is used incorrectly, as in, “I’ll make a quick perusal of this document and then we’ll start the meeting.” Don’t do that. Remember
               that perusal actually means “thorough reading.” The verb form of this word, peruse, dates from the late 15th century, when it meant “use up" or
               "wear out.” So, take care: The perusal of a book could be so intense that it wears the book out![0m
