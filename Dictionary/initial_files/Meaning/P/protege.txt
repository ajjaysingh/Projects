[91m        SHORT  A protégé is a person who receives special protection and promotion from someone more established in a field. If your boss introduces you as his newest
               protégé, you're off to a good start in your career.[0m
[36m         LONG  Essentially, a protégé is a teacher’s pet, someone who is given special status or favors. Often, the word is used for someone who has special standout talent
               and is taken up as an upcoming star or powerhouse. The word’s original associations, however, have nothing to do with talent and everything to
               do with how a person treats the protégé — the source of the word means “protection.”[0m
