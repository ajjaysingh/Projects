[36m         LONG  You can use the noun personification in two ways. In the first, a person who is known for a certain quality, like wisdom, is said to represent that quality in
               a way any can understand, like a patient, generous person who is the personification of kindness. On the other hand, personification can give
               human qualities to something that isn’t human. For example, you might say, “The sea is angry,” assigning it a human emotion.[0m
