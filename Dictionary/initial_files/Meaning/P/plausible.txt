[91m        SHORT  If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very plausible. A

[36m         LONG  Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy stories ‚Äî such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns ‚Äî are not plausible. On the other hand, some
               things in science fiction stories might be plausible: who knows where spaceships will eventually go? If something really seems like it could
               happen, then it's plausible. One of the many tricky parts of life is figuring out what's plausible and what's not.[0m
