[91m        SHORT  A precedent is something that sets a standard for future events. It's hard to say what the legal community would do without the word precedent, since so many

               late because it would set a bad precedent for future bedtimes. A teacher who lets kids chew gum is setting a precedent that gum-chewing will be
               OK in the future. People often refer to a precedent later on as a reference point for how things should be.[0m
