[36m         LONG  The adjective, petulant, is a disapproving term used to describe a bad-tempered child, an adult behaving like an angry child or behavior or this type. Angry
               or annoyed mean the same thing, but if you choose the word, petulant, you are indicating that it is unreasonable or unjustified. Petulant came
               to English in the late 16th century from the Latin petulantem "forward, insolent" but was not recorded to mean childishly irritable until the
               late 1700s.[0m
