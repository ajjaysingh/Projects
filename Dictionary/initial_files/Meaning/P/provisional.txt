[91m        SHORT  Something provisional is temporary, in the sense that it's only valid for a while. You'll often hear provisional used to describe things such as governments,
               elections, contracts, and agreements, all of which can change into something permanent.[0m
[36m         LONG  People who go camping take provisions, which means supplies for the trip. This can be helpful when you're trying to use provisional properly. Remember that

               a rush to start filming, you might consider giving your star a provisional contract, so that you can at least get started. You'll have time to
               replace the provisional one with a permanent one while you film.[0m
