[91m        SHORT  The adjective promiscuous is often used pejoratively to refer to someone who has many romantic partners. However, the word can also be used in a general sense
               to mean "not limited, restrained, or restricted." If you're a promiscuous reader, you'll read just about anything ‚Äî from biographies to science
               fiction to the back of the cereal box.[0m
[36m         LONG  Promiscuous is not limited to a romantic context. Long ago promiscuous described "a disorderly mixture of people and things," and shades of that original
               meaning linger. If a chef at an Italian restaurant is promiscuous, you might find him mixing ingredients from South America or Asia into his
               pasta. Carpet bombing as opposed to targeted invasion might be called a promiscuous use of military force.[0m
