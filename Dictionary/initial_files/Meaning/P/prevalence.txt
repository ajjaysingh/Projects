[91m        SHORT  Prevalence means there is a lot of something. If you get a bad grade on a paper for having a prevalence of typos, you need to proofread your work more

[36m         LONG  The word prevalence comes from the Latin praevalere, meaning "condition of being widespread or general." The word is often used to describe a phenomenon that
               is widespread in a community, like the prevalence of a disease across a country. Prevalence is another word for "commonness." If there's a
               prevalence of thefts in your neighborhood, that means the likelihood of your house getting robbed is pretty high.[0m
