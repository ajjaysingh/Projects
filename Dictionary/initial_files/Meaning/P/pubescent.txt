[91m        SHORT  A pubescent girl or boy is a young person who's just reached the age of puberty, or sexual maturity.[0m
[36m         LONG  Use the adjective pubescent to describe a person who's at the end of childhood growth and is beginning to be fully adult, including being nearly old enough
               physically to reproduce, or have babies. Pubescent girls and boys are at an in-between stage in their lives, no longer little kids, but not yet
               grownups. The root of pubescence is the Latin word pubescere, "grow up, ripen, or come to maturity."[0m
