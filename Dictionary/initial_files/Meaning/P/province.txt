[91m        SHORT  A province is a region within a country. If  you travel to Canada, you'll have to decide whether you want to go to the province of Quebec, or Saskatchewan, or

[36m         LONG  Many countries are divided into provinces. In the U.S. we don't have official provinces; we have states and counties. But we can use province in its other
               meaning, which is "the sphere of one's activities." If you manage a coffee shop and sit there reading and drinking coffee even when you're not
               working, then that shop is your province.[0m
