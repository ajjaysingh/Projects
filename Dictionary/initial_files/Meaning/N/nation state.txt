  :  a form of political organization under which a relatively homogeneous people inhabits a sovereign state; especially :  a state containing one as opposed to several nationalities


  A nation state is a type of state that joins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation, from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state if one accepts the declarative theory of statehood as opposed to the constitutive theory.

  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity, whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one. 

  The term "nation state" implies that the two coincide, in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it.

  "Nation state" formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world.
