[36m         LONG  The noun nostalgia was invented by a Swiss doctor in the late 1600s. He put together the Greek nostos "homecoming" and algos "pain, distress" as a literal
               translation of the German Heimweh "homesickness." Originally, it was a medical diagnosis for mercenary soldiers. Today, it describes a
               bittersweet longing for the past. Think of the dreamy way your grandpa tells stories of his childhood ‚Äî he's got nostalgia.[0m
