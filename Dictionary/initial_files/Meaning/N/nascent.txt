[91m        SHORT  Nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, for example a civilization, a trend, an idea, or an action.  It can also imply a future promise, like

               nascent hopes of your little sister;" your "nascent hula hooping gang;" and "a nascent confidence in your vocabulary."[0m
