[36m         LONG  The noun narcissist today means someone only concerned with his or her own interests or predicament and its origin is from Greek mythology. Narcissus was a
               hunter who was exceptionally beautiful and also just as proud of his looks, ignoring other people around him. He was punished by the gods by
               falling in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Not realizing it was himself he loved, he eventually died from unrequited love.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Narcissistic  personality disorder is a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration and a lack
               of empathy for others. But behind this mask of ultraconfidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.
