[91m        SHORT  When you want to keep all your options open, stay noncommittal. This means you say "maybe" and "I'll see if I can do that," rather than making promises to do
               specific things.[0m
[36m         LONG  It’s pretty easy to figure out the meaning of noncommittal just by picking apart the word. The non- prefix means “not.” And you see the word commit in
               noncommittal. So you know that the word is going to have something to do with “not commit.” You might also recognize the suffix -al, which is a
               tip-off that this word is an adjective that means "not being willing to commit."[0m
