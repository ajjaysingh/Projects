[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective natal to describe something that has to do with birth, like an adopted child's natal family, or birth parents.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word natal shows up a lot when doctors talk about birth and pregnancy, especially in "pre-natal," which describes what happens before a baby is born. You
               can also use natal for things that occur at the same time as a birth, like the position of the stars on that day or the town in which a child
               is born — her natal city. In the fourteenth century, natal meant "pertaining to birthdays," from the Latin word natus, "to be born."[0m
