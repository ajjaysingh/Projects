[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective notorious to describe people, places, or things that are famous for a bad reason.[0m
[36m         LONG  A good synonym for notorious is infamous; both words mean "well-known, and not in a good way." A celebrity convicted of a series of crimes might be referred
               to as notorious, as might a book that has been banned in several countries. The word originally meant just "famous" and could carry either
               positive or negative connotations. Only in recent centuries did the negative uses start to outweigh the positive ones. In general, you'd rather
               be famous than notorious, unless you're looking to build a bad reputation.[0m
