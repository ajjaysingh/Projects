[91m        SHORT  The horrors of war include depredation ‚Äî the plundering and ransacking of the defeated and their homes, the terrible, unrestrained preying on the conquered.
               The word depredation entails all of the pain humans inflict upon each other.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin language makes the noun praeda "prey" into the verb praedƒÅrƒ´, which then means "to plunder." As if that wasn't enough ‚Äî they added the prefix de-,
               "thoroughly," to create a word that says it all. In 15th-century French, the word became depredation, but the meaning was far from refined,
               describing a wholesale pillaging of those who became the "prey" and continuing the history of man‚Äôs inhumanity to man.[0m
