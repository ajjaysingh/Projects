[36m         LONG  You might decry learning French, declaring it as a waste of time. Yet many English words come from French. When the French conquered England in 1066, they
               brought with them their language as well as their social system. Because French was spoken mostly by the ruling class, many of the loan words
               are formal. Decry comes from the Old French descrier, to cry out or announce. When you decry something, you simultaneously condemn it and
               discredit it, a formal act.[0m
