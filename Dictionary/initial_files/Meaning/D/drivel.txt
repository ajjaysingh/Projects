[91m        SHORT  Drivel is useless, boring, nonsensical information. Your parents might think the articles in your favorite fashion magazine are drivel. As a verb, drivel
               means to talk stupidly or to actually drool.[0m
[36m         LONG  Etymologists suspect drivel comes to us from the Old Norse word draf, meaning "malt dregs." This would make sense, given that drivel is usually talk or
               writing about as useless as dregs. If you don't prepare for an oral report, the unfortunate result may be that your teacher finds your
               disorganized ramblings to be pure drivel. Drivel also means to dribble saliva. If a friendly dog licks your hand, leaving it wet and gooey, you
               can assume he driveled on it.[0m
