[91m        SHORT  Hemlock, blue spruce, and white pine are all evergreens. These trees have leaves throughout the year. Oak, maple, and elm are examples of deciduous trees.
               They lose their foliage in the fall and grow new leaves in the spring.[0m
[36m         LONG  Trees, shrubs, and herbaceous perennials that shed their leaves for part of the year are categorized by botanists as deciduous. In temperate and polar
               regions, these plants are generally bare during the cold of winter. In other parts of the world, deciduous plants lose their leaves during the
               dry part of the year. The word deciduous can also be used to describe parts of the body, such as a deer's antlers or human baby teeth, that are
               cast off seasonally or at a particular period of development.[0m
