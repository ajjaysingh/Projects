[91m        SHORT  When you dissuade someone, you convince that person not to do something: ‚ÄúWhen Caroline saw Peter's broken leg, she tried to dissuade him from going on the
               ski trip.‚Äù[0m
[36m         LONG  Remember the meaning of dissuade by comparing it to its more common relative persuade. The suade part that both words share has origins in the Latin root
               suadƒìre, meaning ‚Äúto urge.‚Äù In the case of persuade, the prefix per- means ‚Äúthoroughly,‚Äù intensifying ‚Äúto urge‚Äù and giving persuade its meaning
               of ‚Äúto convince.‚Äù Think of dissuade as the opposite of persuade: the prefix dis- reverses the action of the root, giving the meaning of not
               urging, in other words, convincing someone NOT to do something.[0m
