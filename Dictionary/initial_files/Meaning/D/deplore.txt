[91m        SHORT  The verb deplore is used to express strong disapproval of something. If you really, really hate the way your mom makes meatloaf, then it's safe to say you

[36m         LONG  Deplore comes from Latin roots that mean to bewail or lament. So if you deplore something, you object to it because it brings you sorrow or grief. People
               often deplore things that they regret or feel bad about. You might deplore the inhumane treatment of animals or the deforestation of the
               Amazon. Or maybe you just deplore your wardrobe choices from middle school.[0m
