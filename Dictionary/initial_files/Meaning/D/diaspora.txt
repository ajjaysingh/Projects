[36m         LONG  The term diaspora comes from an ancient Greek word meaning "to scatter about." And that's exactly what the people of a diaspora do ‚Äî they scatter from their
               homeland to places across the globe, spreading their culture as they go. The Bible refers to the Diaspora of Jews exiled from Israel by the
               Babylonians. But the word is now also used more generally to describe any large migration of refugees, language, or culture.[0m
