[91m        SHORT  If people are laughing at you, making fun of you, and acting as if you're worthless, they're treating you with derision. Derision is mean and attacking ‚Äî it's
               a form of contempt.[0m
[36m         LONG  Derision is more than just making fun of someone ‚Äî it's mocking someone so forcefully and with such venom that you discredit the person completely. Derision
               can include literally laughing at someone or just treating a person like a joke. You know how celebrities and politicians do embarrassing
               things from time to time? They're usually treated with derision afterward: people mock them, treat them with contempt, and try to make the
               person who messed up seem completely worthless.[0m
