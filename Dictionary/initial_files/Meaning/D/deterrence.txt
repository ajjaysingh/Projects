[91m        SHORT  A deterrence discourages you from doing something. An invisible electric fence is an excellent deterrence for dogs who like to roam outside the yard.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can influence someone's actions by promoting certain behaviors and discouraging others. And it's the discouragement part where deterrence comes in. A
               deterrence makes you reconsider doing something — usually bad things like stealing or skipping school — because you know the penalty will be
               harsh. Deterrences make you afraid to try something. So many homeowners hope that a security alarm will be a deterrence to burglars.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Deterrence is a strategy intended to dissuade an adversary from taking an action not yet started, or to prevent them from doing something that another state
               desires. A credible nuclear deterrent, Bernard Brodie wrote in 1959, must be always at the ready, yet never used.
