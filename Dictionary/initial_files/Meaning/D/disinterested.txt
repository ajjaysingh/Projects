[91m        SHORT  If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or
               unbiased, party (who will probably tell you not to buy either one).[0m
[36m         LONG  Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and
               English teachers being way too uptight. While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean “unbiased,” the debate rages on as to whether it can
               also mean “uninterested” or “indifferent.” Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this secondary meaning. (Of course, you’ll also find the
               disinterested — or uninterested? — folks who couldn’t care less.)[0m
