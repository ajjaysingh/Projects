[36m         LONG  Use the noun detractor for someone who is always critical. You might describe your brother as a detractor of the government if he complains incessantly about
               taxes, voting, the President, and all the members of Congress. If a person takes a dislike to you in particular, he is your own personal
               detractor. The origin of detractor goes back to the Latin word detrahere, "take down, pull down, or disparage."[0m
