[91m        SHORT  The adjective demeaning describes something that lowers a person's reputation or dignity. If your boss always asks you to pick up her dry cleaning and get her
               coffee, you might feel like you usually get the demeaning jobs.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective demeaning comes from the verb demean, which itself is based on the construction of the word "debase." The word demean has two almost opposite
               meanings, to degrade and to conduct oneself in a particular manner, usually a proper one. The adjective, however, always describes something
               that is degrading. Overhearing two friends gossiping about you can be a demeaning experience, even if they're just criticizing your new
               haircut.[0m
