[91m        SHORT  A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a clear distinction between two things.[0m
[36m         LONG  A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas ‚Äî like war and peace, or love and hate ‚Äî you have a
               dichotomy. You often hear about a "false dichotomy," which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an "either/or" scenario. For
               example, the statement "All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting" creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars
               that don't fit into either category.[0m
