[91m        SHORT  That guy in the drama club who tells everyone he hates organized sports one day and then joins the football team the next? He's being duplicitous, or
               pretending to have feelings that his actions contradict.[0m
[36m         LONG  In duplicitous, you can see the word duplicity, which means "doubleness." Someone who is duplicitous is almost like two people, saying one thing but then
               doing something very different, even contradictory. Someone who is duplicitous can also be called "two-faced," a vivid way to remember that
               this person shouldn't be trusted or taken at face value.[0m
