[91m        SHORT  When you are disparaging, you express negative, low opinions in order to lower someone's reputation. Your friend will probably not appreciate it if you make
               disparaging comments about his girlfriend.[0m

               use disparaging for any derogatory or belittling expression or comment. If just won an Olympic gold medal, it's just rude and unnecessary to be
               disparaging about the silver medalist in an interview. Making disparaging remarks about your wife's cooking is unlikely to result in better
               food. She'll just get mad.[0m
