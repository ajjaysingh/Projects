[91m        SHORT  If you practice diligence, you are a hard and careful worker. Do you have the diligence to read all the collected works of Henry James? Of course not. Nobody

               care and attention and effort, not to mention a close reading of the small print. Diligence may help you realize the Brooklyn Bridge is not
               actually yours to buy, or that your potential neighbor has 112 cats living next door.[0m
