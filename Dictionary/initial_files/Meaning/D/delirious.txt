[91m        SHORT  If you're delirious you're uncontrollably excited or a bit crazy, like when you win the lottery and run screaming through the streets, delirious with
               happiness.[0m
[36m         LONG  While we sometimes like to say, metaphorically, that strong emotions make us delirious, this adjective has more grim origins, in the Latin word for delirium
               or "madness" ‚Äî in the medical sense, that is. When you're delirious from a high fever or a serious bump to the head, you might become
               incoherent, hallucinate, or have disturbing dreams. The story of The Wizard of Oz is based on the delirious dream Dorothy has after she bumps
               her head during a tornado.[0m
