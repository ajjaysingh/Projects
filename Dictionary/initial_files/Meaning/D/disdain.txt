[91m        SHORT  If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may disdain it (or treat it with disdain).[0m
[36m         LONG  In Old French, deignier meant "to treat something as worthy." To disdain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: "Management at [the company] displayed
               a certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization." As a verb, disdain carries an air
               of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like despise, abhor, detest, loathe and scorn. So if you disdain something, you might
               reject it with a haughty scoff, "Ha!"[0m
