[91m        SHORT  A despot, is a cruel, all-controlling ruler. For example, a despot does not allow people to speak out against the leadership, nor really want them to have
               much freedom at all.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word despot came into English in the sixteenth century from Old French, but it traces all the way back to the Greek word despotes, meaning "master of a
               household, lord, absolute ruler." The word is often used to describe someone who abuses power and oppresses others. Obviously, it's not a nice
               thing to call someone, especially within earshot of the despot who has absolute power over you.[0m
