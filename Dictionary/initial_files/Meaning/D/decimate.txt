[91m        SHORT  If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. "The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife
               along the coast."[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in
               decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the
               word decimate its "drastically reduced" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean "to wipe out" or "to eliminate."[0m
