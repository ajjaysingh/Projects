[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective derisive to describe something or someone that mocks, expresses contempt, or ridicules. You may sometimes catch your kids making derisive
               comments — especially if you ask them to do chores instead of whatever they think is more important.[0m
[36m         LONG  Derisive comes from the Latin word deridere, meaning "to ridicule," and is from the roots de-, which means "down," and ridere, which means "to laugh." The
               adjective derisory comes from the same Latin word, but it has a different sense. If you say something derisive, you show contempt or ridicule,
               as in a derisive glare at your noisy neighbors. If you say something is derisory, you mean it invites or deserves ridicule or contempt,
               especially if it is laughably small, such as a derisory diamond chip in an engagement ring.[0m
