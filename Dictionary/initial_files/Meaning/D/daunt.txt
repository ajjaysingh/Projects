[91m        SHORT  The Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz appeared at first to be easily daunted, but, in fact, he showed unusual courage. Still, his efforts to daunt Dorothy,
               the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man were less than successful.[0m
[36m         LONG  When bringing a new kitten home you don't want to daunt it by forcing it out of its carrier too soon‚Äîopen the door and let it come out when it's ready. Daunt
               means to frighten or scare off and, conveniently, it rhymes with haunt, another word which means to frighten, thought in a creepier sense.
               Daunt often shows up as part of the adjective undaunted, which describes someone who remains unafraid or perseveres in the face of scary
               circumstances.[0m
