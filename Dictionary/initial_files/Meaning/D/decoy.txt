[91m        SHORT  A decoy is a fake version of something used to play a trick or lead you into danger, like the cork duck decoys hunters put on the pond to make the real ducks
               think it's safe to stop by.[0m
[36m         LONG  Decoy most often refers to bait used for trapping or killing an animal, but it can be any object or plan used to lead someone or something into trouble.
               Fisherman use worm decoys on their lures to catch fish, just like police use people as undercover decoys to catch criminals. While etymologists
               aren't positive, they suspect decoy comes from the Dutch kooi, which means “a cage.” So think of luring a mouse into a cage with a big slice of
               decoy cheese.[0m
