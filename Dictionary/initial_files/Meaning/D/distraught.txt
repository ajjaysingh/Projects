[91m        SHORT  If you are upset, you are distraught. If you don't want to explain why you are pulling your hair out, just utter "Leave me alone; I'm distraught." It'll work.[0m
[36m         LONG  While distraught may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it is actually an alteration of distract from the Latin distrahere "to draw in different
               directions." If you are distraught, you are so upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is "drawn in different directions."[0m
