[91m        SHORT  To deem is a verb that means to view as or judge. Your parents or boss may deem something necessary that you don't, like coming home by midnight or working
               late.[0m
[36m         LONG  Deem comes from the Old English word, deman ‚Äî meaning "act as a judge." If you deem something, you essentially become the judge of whether it has a
               characteristic. For example, if you deem your little sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably just walk away.[0m
