[36m         LONG  Docent came into English by way of German, tracing back to the Latin word docere, meaning ‚Äúteach.‚Äù Docent typically refers to someone who teaches at a college
               or university, but the term can be used more broadly to mean "someone who promotes learning." If you take a museum tour, it might be led by a
               docent, a volunteer who acts as a guide to the museum‚Äôs collection. Pronounce docent with a long ‚Äúo‚Äù sound and a soft ‚Äúc‚Äù: ‚ÄúDOH-sent.‚Äù[0m
