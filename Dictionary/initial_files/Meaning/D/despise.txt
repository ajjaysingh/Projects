[91m        SHORT  If the mere thought of a burrito with sour cream in it turns your stomach, you could say that you despise sour cream. You loathe it, abhor it, hate it, and
               think it's vile.[0m
[36m         LONG  Despise dates all the way back to the Latin word despicare, which combines de "down" with specere "to look at." So if you look down your nose at something,
               you could say you despise it. Nowadays the word gets used a lot to describe things people really, really dislike, too. Note how similar in
               meaning and spelling despise is to Sylvester the cartoon cat's old favorite catchphrase despicable. Despicable means something worth of being
               despised.[0m
