[36m         LONG  People talk about deterrents most often when discussing crime. The death penalty is supposed to be a deterrent — the idea is that people will be so scared of
               the death penalty that they won't commit certain crimes. Jail is another deterrent. Teachers also use deterrents — the possibility of getting
               detention is a deterrent that should encourage students to behave. A deterrent is the opposite of a reward. A reward encourages you to do the
               right thing, while a deterrent discourages you from doing the wrong thing.[0m
