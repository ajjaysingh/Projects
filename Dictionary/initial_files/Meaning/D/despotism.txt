[91m        SHORT  Despotism is a way of ruling in which the leader has total, unchecked power. Joseph Stalin purged the Soviet Union of all his opponents in order to rule the

               but despotism can describe any situation characterized by oppression and threats. When your sister threatens to send all of your friends
