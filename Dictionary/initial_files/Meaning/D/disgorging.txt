[91m        SHORT  There's really no way to put this delicately. Disgorge is just a fancy word for "puke." You know... "Barf." "Spew." "Upchuck." Usually applied to birds or
               animals rather than people.[0m
[36m         LONG  Okay, actually that's not entirely true. Disgorge also has the other broader, metaphorical meanings of "emptying out," as in: "the bus began to disgorge its
               passengers;" or "he finally began to disgorge his secrets." So, actually, yes, it does mean a lot more than just "puke." Sorry.[0m
