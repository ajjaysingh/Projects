[36m         LONG  Discretion traces back to the Latin verb discernere "to separate, to discern" from the prefix dis- "off, away" plus cernere "separate, sift." If you use
               discretion, you sift away what is not desirable, keeping only the good. If you have the freedom to choose, something is "at your discretion."
