[91m        SHORT  Let‚Äôs hope you‚Äôre never denied food and sleep and forced to sign a confession, but if you are, that's called being under duress. Threats and harsh treatment
               meant to make you do something you don‚Äôt want to do is duress.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word duress came into English through French, with origins in the Latin word duritia, which means ‚Äúhardness.‚Äù First used to describe harsh or cruel
               treatment, duress soon took on the additional meaning of forcing someone to do something, usually through threats. Duress is typically used
               with the word under, as in a suspect who only signs a confession because he is under duress.[0m
