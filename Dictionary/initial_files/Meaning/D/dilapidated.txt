[36m         LONG  Sure, there might be crooked floorboards, mice scurrying underfoot, and pieces missing from the ceiling, but that dilapidated house does come with one perk: a
               cheaper price tag! Dilapidated is a word that implies deterioration, often because of neglect. So if you don’t take care of things, they can
               become dilapidated. That goes for houses, tree forts, relationships, health —  you name it![0m
