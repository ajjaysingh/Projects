[36m         LONG  Do is one of the most frequently used verbs in English. You do many things in a typical day: you might do the dishes, do your job, and later on, do your
               taxes. If you meet an old-fashioned gentleman, he might say, "How do you do?" essentially meaning, "Hello." After a difficult test, your friend
               could ask, "How did you do?" You can also do as you please, or just do nothing all day long.[0m
