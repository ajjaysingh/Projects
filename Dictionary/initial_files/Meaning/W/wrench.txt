[91m        SHORT  To wrench means to grab or pull something with a lot of physical force. See this teddy bear? If you want it, you‚Äôll have to wrench it out of my hands, because

[36m         LONG  Maybe you have a wrench at home, that is, a hand tool that is used to hold or twist a nut or a pipe joint. If so, you also have a great way to remember what
               wrench the verb means. Just imagine you're  twisting with a wrench, except instead of using a tool, you‚Äôre using your hands. If something is
               heart wrenching, it makes you feel very sad. If you wrench a part of your body, you strain, pull or twist it, injuring yourself in some way.[0m
