	Wiki Definition:
              	A  picket fence , ideally  white , has iconic status as Americana, symbolizing the ideal middle-class suburban life, with a family and children (2.5 children
               and a dog), large house, and peaceful living. This stems from the fact that houses in quiet, middle-class neighborhoods often have gardens
               enclosed by  picket fences .
