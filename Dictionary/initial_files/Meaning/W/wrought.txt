[91m        SHORT  Wrought is an adjective that means "molded," "shaped," or "manufactured." A wrought-iron fence has been shaped to fit a particular ornamental style.[0m
[36m         LONG  Wrought is most often used to describe the shaping, altering, molding, and manufacture of various metals, like iron, steel, aluminum. However, the word is
               actually related to wreak, which means "to cause damage." So we'll sometimes refer to the destruction wrought by a storm or some mad scientist
               like Dr. Frankenstein might lament the monster he has wrought with his hands.[0m
