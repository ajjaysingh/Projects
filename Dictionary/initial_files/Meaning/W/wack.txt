[36m         LONG  Use the adjective wacky when you're talking about someone with a ridiculous sense of humor. Clowns are, by definition, wacky, for example. Most people have at
               least one wacky relative, and some are lucky enough to have entire wacky families. Wacky comes from the nineteenth century British slang term
               whacky, which arose from whack, specifically the idea of getting whacked on the head so hard that it turns you wacky.[0m
