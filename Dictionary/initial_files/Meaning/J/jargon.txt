[36m         LONG  This noun can also refer to language that uses long sentences and hard words. If you say that someone's speech or writing is full of jargon, this means you
               don't approve of it and think it should be simplified. In Middle English, this word referred to chattering, so its origin is probably
               imitative: it echoes the sound of chatter or meaningless words.[0m
