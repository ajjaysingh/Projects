[91m        SHORT  When a government is overthrown, the coalition or group that forms and takes control is called a junta. If the military has seized control, as so often
               happens, then the group is called a military junta.[0m
[36m         LONG  Junta is pronounced with an initial h sound, which gives you a clue to its origins. It’s from the Spanish junta, for a military or political group ruling the
               country after it has been taken over. Spanish got junta from the Latin jungere, to join. Remember, all the players in the junta must join
               together to overthrow the government.[0m
