[91m        SHORT  Instead of complaining about your chores, be grateful for the conduit, or pipe, that brings water to your home. Thanks to it, you don't have to go fetch water
               from the well whenever your mom wants a cup of coffee.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun conduit comes from root words meaning "pipe," and the word retains this definition. For example, a channel between a reservoir and a water treatment
               plant could be called a conduit. Conduit can also be used in a figurative sense to refer to someone or something that conveys goods,
               information, or ideas. For instance, a religious leader might be seen as a conduit who brings divine messages to the people.[0m
