[91m        SHORT  The tricky word conundrum is used to describe a riddle or puzzle, sometimes including a play on words or pun.[0m
[36m         LONG  One of the most famous conundrums is the riddle of the Sphinx, famously in the play Oedipus the King by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a mythical
               beast, who asks him, "What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?" The answer is "A person":
               crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked you the riddle and you
               didn't know, she'd eat you![0m
