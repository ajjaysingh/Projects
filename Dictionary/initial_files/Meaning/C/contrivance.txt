[91m        SHORT  A contrivance is a gadget or device that can be used for some particular purpose. The spinning blade of a blender is a contrivance that turns fruits and
               yogurt into a tasty smoothie. Yum.[0m
[36m         LONG  A contrivance is a useful device or tool. It might be assembled or invented, and it's often mechanical, although you can really refer to anything that's made
               for a specific purpose as a contrivance. The word sometimes also implies a falseness or obviousness, like the contrivance of a spy's very fake-
               looking beard that's supposed to disguise him, or the contrivance of a novel's complicated, unbelievable plot.[0m
