[91m        SHORT  Claustrophobia is an irrational or abnormal fear of being in an enclosed space.  If your heart races in an elevator, or you break out in a cold sweat in a
               walk-in closet, you might have claustrophobia.[0m
[36m         LONG  Claustrophobia is made of ancient Latin words.  Phobia  means "fear," and  claustro  means "bolt" ‚Äî the kind you put on a door. Broadly speaking, the opposite
               of claustrophobia is agoraphobia, which is the fear of open spaces. For fun, try adding "-phobia" to your own personal source of dread! For
               example, ‚Äúmath-phobia.‚Äù[0m
