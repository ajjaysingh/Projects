[91m        SHORT  To confide in someone is to tell them something privately. We confide in people we trust.[0m
[36m         LONG  We all have secrets and subjects that are hard to talk about. When we want to talk about something sensitive, we look for someone to confide in: a person we
               trust not to blab about our business to the rest of the world. Most people confide in close friends or family, often to get advice. If you tell
               someone a secret, and then they tell ten of their friends, you made a mistake by confiding in that person.[0m
