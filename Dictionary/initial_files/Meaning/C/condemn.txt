[91m        SHORT  You can condemn, or openly criticize, someone who is behaving inappropriately. If you are an animal rights activist, you would probably condemn someone for
               wearing fur.[0m
[36m         LONG  Condemn originally comes, through Old French, from the Latin word condemnƒÅre, "to sentence, condemn." You may see politicians condemn each other in political
               ads during a campaign in hopes of improving their chances of winning an election. You also might hear of a convict being "condemned to death."
               In this sense of the word, to condemn still carries on its Latin meaning of "to sentence."[0m
