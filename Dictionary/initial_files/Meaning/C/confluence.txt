[91m        SHORT  Confluence means a flowing together. In a literal sense, it's about rivers. But it's more often used to talk about the coming together of factors or ideas, or
               of cultures in a diverse city.[0m
[36m         LONG  Con- means "with," and -fluence sounds like "flow." When things come together like rivers do, flowing from entirely different places, you call that a
               confluence. If the senior class needs to raise money for a class trip, and the drama club is looking for someone to do concessions during
               intermission at the school play, that's a confluence of factors.[0m
