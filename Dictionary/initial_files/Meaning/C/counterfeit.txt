[91m        SHORT  A counterfeit is a fake or a forgery. If you painted an uncanny copy of the "Mona Lisa" and tried to pass it off as the original, you'd have a counterfeit on
               your hands.[0m
[36m         LONG  An exact imitation of anything — a work of art, a ten dollar bill — is a counterfeit, and the act of creating the fake copy is the verb to counterfeit.  You
               can also describe the forgery using the adjective form of counterfeit: a counterfeit Rolex watch. In Old French, the word contre, "counter or
               against",  together with the word faire, "to make," joined together to mean "to make in imitation," which led to our counterfeit.[0m
