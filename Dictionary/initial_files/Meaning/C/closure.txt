[91m        SHORT  Closure is the end or the closing down of something. It can be physical ‚Äî like the closure of your local library ‚Äî or emotional, like the closure you

[36m         LONG  Closure comes from the Latin claus ("shut"), and it has many different shades of meaning. A road closure blocks that road from traffic. If you find closure
               after an emotional hardship, you're ready to move on. An obstruction in a small passage, like a pipe, is also a closure, as is the button on
               your sweater. In debate, closure (usually cloture), stops debate and starts the vote.[0m
