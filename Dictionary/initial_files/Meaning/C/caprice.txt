[36m         LONG  The word caprice has its roots in the French for "whim," which comes from the Italian word capriccio for "fright" or "sudden start." A caprice can be just a
               fun impulsive act, but it also can be something done on a quick whim, without thinking it through or preparing for the change in direction.
               Having a sudden liking, or caprice, for someone or something can be short-lived too.[0m
