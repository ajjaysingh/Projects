[91m        SHORT  Consortium is a fancy word for a group you form for an enterprise beyond what any one member could do alone. All the grocery stores in your neighborhood might form a consortium for the
               promotion of local strawberries.[0m
[36m         LONG  Consortium comes from the verb consort, which means "to accompany or associate." Consortium used to mean "fellowship, participation, society," but these days you're more likely to hear
               consortium for an association of different institutions like schools or companies than, say, a consortium of philosophical frog lovers. Still, consortiums usually
               preserve the ideals of fellowship, with every member institution chipping in to reach a common goal.[0m
