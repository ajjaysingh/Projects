[36m         LONG  Sometimes the mere sight or smell of something can conjure or stir up long lost memories, magically transporting you back to another place and time. But in
               the early 13th century, conjure was a bit more sinister ‚Äî it meant using a spell to capture a demon to do one's bidding. In our modern day,
               conjure still carries the meaning of summoning a spirit, but it more regularly means to summon an idea or bring something into existence.[0m
