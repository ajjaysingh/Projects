[91m        SHORT  Conglomeration is a fancy word for a bunch of stuff brought together. People, companies, ideas, and other things can group together in conglomerations.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you ever want something and you're asked why, you could show off your vocabulary and say, "I have a conglomeration of reasons!" That means you have a bunch
               of reasons that may or may not be connected. A huge mob of people could be described as a conglomeration ‚Äî which sounds nicer than "mob." The
               "with" should be a reminder that this is a word that brings things or people together. In the dictionary, you'll find a conglomeration of words
               ‚Äî like "conversation" and "concert" ‚Äî that use con- to suggest a bringing together.[0m
