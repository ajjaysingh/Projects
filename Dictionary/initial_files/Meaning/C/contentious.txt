[36m         LONG  Some issues ‚Äî like abortion, the death penalty, and gun control ‚Äî are very controversial. They're also contentious, because people tend to argue about them,
               and the arguments will probably go on forever. Contentious issues get people angry and in a fighting mood. On the other hand, some people
               always seem to be in a fighting mood, no matter what the issue is. People like that are contentious too.[0m
