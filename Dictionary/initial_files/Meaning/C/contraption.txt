[91m        SHORT  A contraption is a device that has a specific purpose and is often overly complicated. If your dad yells, “Get that contraption out of here!” He doesn’t

               or gizmos — are devices people make for various purposes. Often, this word is used when someone isn't quite sure what something is, as in
               "What's that contraption?" Oh that’s just a dog-walking machine made of a roller skate, bacon, and four paper clips.[0m
