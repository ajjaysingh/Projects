[91m        SHORT  A man who is courteous and attentive to women can be described as chivalrous: ‚ÄúThe chivalrous stranger picked up the packages Veronica dropped and held the
               door open while she entered the apartment building.‚Äù[0m
[36m         LONG  The word chivalrous originally described gallantry, valor, honor, and courtesy, associated with the medieval code of knighthood. Medieval knights are no
               longer with us, but chivalrous has survived in modern usage to describe a man ‚Äî or a behavior ‚Äî showing courtesy or attentiveness toward women.
               So the guy holding the door open for you with a flourish may or may not be your ‚Äúknight in shining armor," but his chivalrous act gives him
               something in common with the medieval knights of lore.[0m
