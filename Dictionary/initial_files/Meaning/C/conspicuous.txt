[36m         LONG  Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb, conspicere, meaning "to look at." Conspicuous can mean either very obvious to the eye (like
               something that is conspicuous from a distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If you are doing something wrong, it's
               wise not to be conspicuous about it![0m
