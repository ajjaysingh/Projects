[91m        SHORT  A condolence is an expression of sympathy and sorrow to someone who has suffered a loss, like the letter of condolence you send to a faraway friend who has

[36m         LONG  The noun condolence comes from the Late Latin word condole, meaning ‚Äúto suffer together.‚Äù When you offer your condolences to someone who has suffered a loss,
               you are saying that you share their sadness, that you are there to support and help them. Don't confuse condolence with consolation, which is
               an attempt to make the person feel better.[0m
