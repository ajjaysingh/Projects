[36m         LONG  Conveyance is a rather archaic ‚Äî or old-fashioned ‚Äî way to describe a mode of transportation. It's easy to imagine someone in the 1800s asking for a horse and
               carriage as their conveyance to a friend's house. Today, we'd skip the formalities and simply jump in the car and drive there ourselves. In its
               less common usage, a conveyance is a legal document that transfers ownership of a property from one person to another.[0m
