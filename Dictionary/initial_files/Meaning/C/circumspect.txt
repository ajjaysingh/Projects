[36m         LONG  The word circumspect was borrowed from Latin circumspectus, from circumspicere "to be cautious." The basic meaning of Latin circumspicere is "to look around."
               Near synonyms are prudent and cautious, though circumspect implies a careful consideration of all circumstances and a desire to avoid mistakes
               and bad consequences.[0m
