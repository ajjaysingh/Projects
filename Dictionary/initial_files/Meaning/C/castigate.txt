[91m        SHORT  Use castigate  when you mean reprimand but in an especially harsh way. If you take a mean teacher's books, even accidentally, you might worry that she's going
               to castigate you as soon as she finds out.[0m
[36m         LONG  Castigate means punish, and punish harshly, but the punishment is always a severe scolding. Sometimes it means criticize severely. Politicians in the Senate
               are always castigating each other for their alliances and opinions. Castigate and chasten, which also means "to reprimand" but is less severe,
               share the Latin root castus which means "pure." Ideally, if you castigate someone, you mean to guide someone away from the wrong path and
               toward a more pure one. But it sure doesn't feel like that when you're being castigated![0m
