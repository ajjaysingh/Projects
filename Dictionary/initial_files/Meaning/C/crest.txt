[91m        SHORT  A crest is a showy tuft of feathers on the head of a bird. It's easy to identify a male cardinal by its bright red color and the tufted crest on its head.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin word crista, which crest comes from, means "tuft or comb."An animal's crest can be feathers, fur, skin, or a comb like a rooster's. Something that
               resembles such a feature can also be called a crest, such as a plume on an old-fashioned helmet. The top or highest part of something is also a
               crest, like the crest of a hill or the crest of a wave. As a verb, crest means "to reach the top" like when you crest a mountain.[0m
