[91m        SHORT  Unless you're living in a cave cut off from humanity, you've seen these electronic machines with a screen, keyboard, and brain that stores massive amounts of
               information. Computers are ubiquitous in offices, airports, schools...even caves cut off from humanity.[0m
[36m         LONG  Though computers are a thoroughly modern invention, the root word that gave them their name dates all the way back to Roman times. Tech geeks dreamed up
               computer by embellishing the English word compute, which means to calculate. Compute, in turn, comes from Latin com- "with" and putare "to
               reckon." So, your computer is a device that helps you reckon â€” or think. It also comes in handy for email and every type of entertainment
               imaginable.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	" Compadre " is also a traditional term of reverence and friendship for a man. ... In English,  compadre  means "friend and can refer to a person of either
               sex." "Comadre" continues to appear occasionally in English contexts, but it is not yet well enough established to merit entry in English
               dictionaries.
