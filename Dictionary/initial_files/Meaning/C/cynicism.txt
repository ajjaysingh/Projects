[91m        SHORT  Cynicism is the feeling of distrust or that something isn't going to work out well. Some people feel cynicism when politicians make big promises.[0m
[36m         LONG  To pronounce cynicism, place the accent on the first syllable: "SIH-nuh-cih-zum." You might associate cynicism with sarcasm. Cynicism comes from believing
               that people are, at heart, selfish and untrustworthy. Sarcasm is the expression of negative feelings like cynicism, by expressing, for dramatic
               effect, the opposite of what is meant: "I'm quite sure that politician took that bribe by mistake. We all know how easy it is to overlook the
               sudden appearance of $2 million dollars in your checking account."[0m
