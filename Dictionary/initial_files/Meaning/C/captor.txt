[91m        SHORT  Someone who catches a person or animal and keeps them confined or imprisoned is a captor. Visiting the zoo, you might find yourself wondering if the lions see
               the zookeepers as friends or as captors.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word captor sounds a little bit like capture, and it's no coincidence — they're both rooted in the Latin capere, "to take, hold, or seize." So if you
               capture a cricket and keep it in a little cage, you are its captor. And, when a police force captures a criminal and puts them in prison, the
               police become captors too. The original meaning of captor was actually "a censor."[0m
