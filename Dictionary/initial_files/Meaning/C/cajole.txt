[36m         LONG  The origin of this word is probably a blend of two French words meaning "to chatter like a jaybird" and "to lure into a cage." When you cajole that guy into
               lending you some money, picture him as the bird going into the cage. In fact, the word cajole may be associated with another French word
               meaning "to put in jail."[0m
