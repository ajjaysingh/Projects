[91m        SHORT  If you're a rookie or new to something, you could be described as callow ‚Äî like callow freshmen in high school or the callow receptionist who can't figure out
               how to transfer a call.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word callow comes from the Old English word calu, which meant "bald or featherless." It was used to describe young, fledgling birds. Over time, the
               meaning expanded to include young, inexperienced people. You'll most often see the adjective paired with the noun youth. Think of the callow
               youth as people who haven't tested their wings yet.[0m
