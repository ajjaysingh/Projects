[91m        SHORT  "White bunny. Moon. Square." Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic. Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand

[36m         LONG  Cryptic is from Late Latin crypticus, from Greek kryptikos, from kryptos "hidden." This Greek adjective is the source of our English word crypt, referring to
               a room under a church in which dead people are buried. That might account for why the word cryptic has an eerie tone to it.[0m
