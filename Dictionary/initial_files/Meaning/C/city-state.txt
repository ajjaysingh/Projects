[91m        SHORT  A city-state is an independent city ‚Äî and sometimes its surrounding land ‚Äî which has its own government, completely separate from nearby countries. Monaco is

[36m         LONG  Today, there are only five city-states that are truly self-governing, but in the past this was more common. In fact, well-known cities such as Rome and Athens
               were city-states, and the entire country of Italy was made up of independent merchant city-states during the Renaissance. These days,
               government tends to be concentrated in a larger country, rather than split into small, sovereign cities.[0m
