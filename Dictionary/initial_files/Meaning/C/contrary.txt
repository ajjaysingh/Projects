[36m         LONG  A contrary child is one who opposes people in authority. As a noun, the contrary means the opposite, as in "We will not give up; on the contrary, we will
               fight with all our power." The adjective contrary derives from Latin contrarius "opposite, opposed," from contra "against."[0m
