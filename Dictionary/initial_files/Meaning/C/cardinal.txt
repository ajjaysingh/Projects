[91m        SHORT  In Catholicism, a cardinal is a high-ranking bishop. In math, you use cardinal numbers to count. A cardinal rule is one that is central and should not be
               broken.[0m

               to describe words of behavior like rule or sin. In the Church, cardinals form the central governing body, and in math the cardinal numbers
               (one, two, three) are the numbers you learn and use first.[0m
