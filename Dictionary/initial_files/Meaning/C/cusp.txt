[91m        SHORT  A cusp in geometry is the point where two curves meet. It's a kind of transition. If you're on the cusp of manhood, you‚Äôre not quite grown up, but you‚Äôre
               definitely not a little boy anymore either.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word comes from Latin cuspis, "point." You'll see lots of cusps in Gothic churches ‚Äî a point where two arches meet, or where decorative curves meet to
               form a point. The little points that stick out on the surface of your teeth that are flat on top ‚Äî the ones you use for grinding ‚Äî are also
               called cusps. Those teeth right behind your canine teeth but before your molars have two cusps, and they're called bicuspids.[0m
