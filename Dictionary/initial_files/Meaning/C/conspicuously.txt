[36m         LONG  The adverb conspicuously is perfect for describing things that happen in a clear or showy way. If you want to attract attention, you might conspicuously toss
               water balloons at cars driving by or conspicuously juggle oranges in the grocery store. Conspicuously comes from the adjective conspicuous, or
               "easily visible," which has a Latin root, conspicuus, "open to view or striking."[0m
