[36m         LONG  The word cohort was originally used to describe a military unit in ancient Rome. You can see how this retains traces of the word‚Äôs origins: cohorts are bound
               together by similar circumstances just like a group of soldiers in a military unit. Some  language purists insist that the word only describe a
               group, such as a cohort of accountants, but it can also refer to companions or supporters, such as ‚ÄúSusie and her cohorts.‚Äù[0m
