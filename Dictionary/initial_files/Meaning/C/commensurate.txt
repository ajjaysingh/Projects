[91m        SHORT  The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate
               punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.[0m
[36m         LONG  When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison ‚Äî that
               penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to
               another.[0m
