[91m        SHORT  Contusion is really just a fancy word for a bad bruise. Professional athletes are often benched suffering from contusions. After all, if they're being paid
               millions, it sounds kinda wimpy to pull them because they're suffering from a...bruise.[0m
[36m         LONG  A contusion is any damage to the body that doesn't break the skin but ruptures the blood capillaries beneath, resulting in a handsome-looking discoloration.
               For once, it's a medical term not used widely to describe a broader emotional or psychological state. You could talk about an "emotional
               contusion," but please, better not to. There are better terms around (see heartbroken, wounded, forlorn, etc.). Your audience will thank you.[0m
