[91m        SHORT  To convulse is to have spasms. Get help immediately if you see someone convulse. This medical condition can be brought on by something simple (like a rise in
               body temperature) or something more complicated, such as epilepsy.[0m
[36m         LONG  In addition to being a symptom of a medical condition, to convulse is often applied to people shaking with laughter. So if you go to a club and see a
               hilarious comedian, you may convulse with laughter so hard that you might cry, or not be able to catch your breath, and your sides hurt.[0m
