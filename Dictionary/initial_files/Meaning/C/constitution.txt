[91m        SHORT  A constitution is a statement of the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or group, such as the U.S. Constitution. Another very common meaning of
               constitution is the physical makeup of a person.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun constitution is from Latin, from constitutus "set up, established" plus the suffix -ion- "act, state, or condition." So think of a constitution as
               how a body (yours, the government's) is set up. If you have a strong constitution, it means you don't get sick very often.[0m
