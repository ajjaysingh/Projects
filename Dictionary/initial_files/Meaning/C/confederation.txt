[91m        SHORT  When a group of people or nations form an alliance, it is called a confederation, allowing each member to govern itself but agreeing to work together for common causes. Perhaps the
               best-known confederation was the South during the U.S. Civil War.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun confederation comes from the early 15th Century, meaning ‚Äúan agreement.‚Äù  Confederation is similar to the word "federation," but with important differences. Whereas a
               federation has a strong central government, a confederation is more of an agreement between separate bodies to cooperate with each other. The European alliance could be
               called a confederation, while the United States is a federation.[0m
