[91m        SHORT  A colloquium is an academic conference or meeting. At a colloquium, you‚Äôll spend a couple of days listening to lectures with a group of people who all know a
               lot about one particular subject.[0m
[36m         LONG  The root of colloquium is the Latin loqui, meaning ‚Äúto talk, ‚Äù which is what people tend to do at a conference. If you‚Äôre attending a colloquium on
               hummingbirds, you‚Äôre going to meet a lot of biologists who talk about hummingbirds. If you‚Äôre giving a lecture at the same colloquium, you‚Äôd
               better hope you know a lot about hummingbirds or you might get run out of the conference![0m
