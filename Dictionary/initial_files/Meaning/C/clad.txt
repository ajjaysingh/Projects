[36m         LONG  As it applies to what a person is wearing, clad is the past participle of clothe. If you wanted to talk about the day your friend commanded you to clothe
               yourself in green and you obeyed, you'd say, "I clad myself in green." Of course, it sounds archaic. Like talking about your shoes by saying
               shod.[0m
