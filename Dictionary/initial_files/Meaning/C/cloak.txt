[36m         LONG  As a noun, a cloak is usually a loose piece of clothing that you wear over your other clothes, like a cape or a gown. It especially refers to an outer garment
               that you might wear while traveling in order to protect your outfit or to conceal your identity. As a verb, to cloak is to conceal or hide
               something. If you were a famous person who wanted to go out alone, you might cloak your identity with a cloak.[0m
