[91m        SHORT  We are sorry to inform you that the adjective contrite means regretful, remorseful, or even guilty.[0m
[36m         LONG  Someone who feels remorse or guilt is contrite and in addition to feeling sorry, part of the definition includes wanting to atone for having done something
               wrong. The word comes from the Latin roots com- meaning "together" and terere which means "to rub." It's also related to the Latin word
               conterere and is defined as "to bruise." In the field of theology being contrite is "being remorseful for past sin and resolved to avoid future
               sin."[0m
