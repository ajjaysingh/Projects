[91m        SHORT  A movie, play, or song that makes you cry is called cathartic. Most good writers try to create work that causes you to experience a strong rush of emotion.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you've been feeling like you need a good cry, you should watch a cathartic movie like Bambi ‚Äî or any film that's sure to make you weep. Things that are
               cathartic don't always call up tears. Things that makes you scream, like a roller-coaster ride or a boxing match, are also cathartic. Whatever
               causes you to release a sudden flood of feelings is cathartic. Some therapies ask you to hit a pillow or break dishes, because those are
               cathartic activities.[0m
