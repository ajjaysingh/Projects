[91m        SHORT  Cleave, a verb, has two very different meanings. It can describe cutting or splitting something apart with a sharp instrument, or ‚Äî oddly enough ‚Äî it can
               describe sticking to something like glue.[0m
[36m         LONG  To cleave or not to cleave, that is the question.  Cleave can refer to being in close contact, to staying really, really close to someone or something: "If
               you are walking in the pitch-black woods without a flashlight, you want to cleave to the person in front of you."  On the other hand, it can
               mean to split apart with a sharp tool ‚Äî which is not the action you want to happen while walking in the woods. We've seen that movie.[0m
