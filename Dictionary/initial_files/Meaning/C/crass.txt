[91m        SHORT  A crass comment is very stupid and shows that the speaker doesn't care about other people's feelings. In today's day and age, you don't have to wear black to
               a funeral, but to show up in clown pants is simply crass.[0m
[36m         LONG  The source of this adjective is Latin crassus "thick, dense, fat." A similar development of meaning can be seen in English dense in the sense of "stupid, slow
               to understand," from Latin densus "thick, dense," and in English thick, which can also be used to mean "stupid."[0m
