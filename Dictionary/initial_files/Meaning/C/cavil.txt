[91m        SHORT  If your only cavil to your family's trip to Disney World is that you don't like airline food, you're not representing the anti-Mickey side of the argument

[36m         LONG  Cavil is not a word that comes up all that often. You can replace it with the more commonly used word  quibble and still have the same meaning. If you cavil
               over a restaurant bill, you argue about the minute, unimportant details of who owes what ‚Äì‚Äì like whether your portion of the bill is $10.00 or
               $10.50.[0m
