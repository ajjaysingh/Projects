[36m         LONG  The gruesome word carcass is often used to describe the remains of a dead animal, especially one that's been slaughtered for food. But if that makes you
               squeamish, you can think of carcasses in a more figurative light, because a carcass could also mean "the inner structure of something." The
               carcass of an old burned out building, for example, refers to its remaining walls and beams. Or think of the carcass of the couch, its inner
               foundation, which is supporting your rear right now.[0m
