[91m        SHORT  When something is veritable it is true, or at least feels that way. "The trees and lights turned the campus into a veritable wonderland" means that the campus
               seemed to be transformed into a true wonderland (if there is such a thing).[0m
[36m         LONG  Veritable comes from the Latin veritas which means true. But unlike true, it does not describe things like statements. It is often used to enhance the word
               that follows it. "A veritable cornucopia of food" is a lot of food of different varieties. If someone calls you "a veritable force of nature,"
               they don't mean that you are actually a hurricane; they just mean that you have the unstoppable quality of a big old storm.[0m
