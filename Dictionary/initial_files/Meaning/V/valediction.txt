[91m        SHORT  A valediction is a speech that wishes a group of people farewell. It's most commonly given at graduations.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word diction in valediction is a clue that this word has to do with speaking, since it comes from the Latin root dicere, "to say." When combined with
               valere, "be well," the result is valedicere, "bid farewell." Just about any type of school that has a graduation ceremony will have a
               valediction, which typically congratulates students on their accomplishments and inspires them to look ahead.[0m
