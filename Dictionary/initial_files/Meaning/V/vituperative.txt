[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective vituperative to describe criticism that's so sharp it hurts. A vituperative review of a movie would make the director bitter for months.[0m

               Being vituperative takes criticism to the next level. Vituperative criticism is harsh, scathing, even abusive. If a review or assessment is
               vituperative, it doesn't say "try harder next time." Instead it gives the sense of "go away and never come back."[0m
