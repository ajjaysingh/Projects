[91m        SHORT  If you're learning a skill that could lead to a specific job, like how to repair cars or how to be a chef, you're getting vocational training. Vocational
               means "related to a career."[0m
[36m         LONG  A vocation is a job or career, so something vocational is related to a specific kind of work. There are vocational schools that train people for jobs, which
               might be what you think of when you read the word vocational, though it could describe anything related to working. Vocational comes from the
               Latin word vocationem, or "a calling." It originally meant a spiritual calling, but grew to include employment in the 16th century.[0m
