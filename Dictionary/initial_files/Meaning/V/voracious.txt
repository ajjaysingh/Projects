[91m        SHORT  Voracious is an adjective used to describe a wolflike appetite. It might be a craving for food or for something else, such as power, but the word usually
               denotes an unflattering greediness.[0m
[36m         LONG  Voracious comes from the Latin vorƒÅre, "to devour." The word is usually associated with swallowing or devouring food in a ravenous manner, but it can be used
               of someone intensely involved in any activity. Pierre Salinger referred to President Kennedy as a "voracious reader," while Robert Bakker once
               likened the IRS to a "voracious, small-minded predator."[0m
