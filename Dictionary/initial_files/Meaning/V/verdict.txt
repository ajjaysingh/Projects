[91m        SHORT  A verdict is a decision made after a lot of considering, usually made by the jury in a courtroom. If you've finally decided that the test was unfair, that's
               your verdict and you should talk to the teacher about it.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although verdicts are usually announced in a courtroom, any time someone makes a judgment about something, it's a verdict. The truth lies in the root of this
               word: ver comes from the Latin verus, meaning "true." Ver shows up in other words ‚Äî to verify something is to prove that it's true, and
               veracious is an adjective meaning "truthful."     And the truth is exactly what the judge needs when he's trying to decide the verdict of a
               case.[0m
