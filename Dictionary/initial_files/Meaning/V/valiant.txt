[91m        SHORT  It was pretty courageous of the automaker Plymouth to name a car the "Valiant" in the 1960s and 70s because that term usually refers to a hero or describes a
               really determined, or valiant, effort that doesn't end well.[0m
[36m         LONG  Synonyms for valiant include "heroic" and "courageous," so it isn‚Äôt surprising that those who serve in the military often are called valiant. The 14th-century
               French origins of the word are "bold" or "of worth," which makes the adjective valiant a good one for describing ordinary people who put all
               they have into something, making their efforts valiant, even if they fail. The Plymouth Valiant, by the way, was considered a strong and
               successful car, though valiant usually refers to people.[0m
