[36m         LONG  The noun vet is short for either veteran (of the Armed Forces) or veterinarian (animal doctor). As a verb, vet means "to carefully examine beforehand." For
               example, your boss might ask you to vet people's applications before calling them for interviews, just to make sure they have the right
               experience for the job. Medically speaking, when a doctor vets you ‚Äî or an animal ‚Äî medical care is given.[0m
