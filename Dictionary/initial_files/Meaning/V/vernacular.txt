[91m        SHORT  Vernacular describes everyday language, including slang, that's used by the people. The vernacular is different from literary or official language: it's the
               way people really talk with each other, like how families talk at home.[0m
[36m         LONG  You know how some language is fancy and formal? Vernacular is different: think of it as how friends talk when no one is listening. Vernacular language
               includes slang and obscenities. One of the hardest things about writing for school is getting away from the vernacular and learning to write in
               more formal ways that don't come as naturally. You can also say specific groups have a vernacular, meaning the unique way people in a certain
               region or profession speak.[0m
