[91m        SHORT  Vanity is the quality of being vain, or having a ridiculous amount of pride. If you have excessive vanity in your appearance, you probably spend long hours
               sitting at your vanity table doing your makeup or plucking your nose hairs.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you pride yourself on looking absolutely perfect and refuse to do any work that might dirty your clothes or mess up your hair, someone might accuse you of
               vanity. Often vanity is empty, like the emperor‚Äôs in The Emperor's New Clothes. If someone pays to have her own book published even though it‚Äôs
               really bad, we say it is a vanity printing.[0m
