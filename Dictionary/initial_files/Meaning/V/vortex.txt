[91m        SHORT  Think vortex and picture a tornado or whirlpool ‚Äî swirling around, causing destruction.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you picture a whirlpool spinning and draining like water out of a bathtub, you'll get a pretty good impression of what a vortex looks like. Dorothy from
               The Wizard of Oz found out first-hand the meaning of vortex as she and her house whirled around in the funnel cloud of a tornado. In a
               figurative sense, vortex can be used to tell about something that seems like it is  whirling out of control, all consuming, or chaotic. This
               may include exam week, your relationships, or your life in general.[0m
