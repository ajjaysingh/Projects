[91m        SHORT  A viaduct is a bridge made of connected sections. Most viaducts are a series of arches that span a road.[0m
[36m         LONG  Some viaducts stretch across train tracks, while other carry traffic across valleys, gorges, or bodies of water. What's distinctive about older viaducts is
               that they're usually made of equal-sized arches all linked into one long bridge. Newer viaducts can look simply like an elevated road or
               highway. The word viaduct combines the Latin via, or "road," with ducere, "to lead something."[0m
