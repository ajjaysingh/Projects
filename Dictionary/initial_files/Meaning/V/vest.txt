[91m        SHORT  A vest is a sleeveless piece of clothing that's usually worn over a shirt. Your dad might love to wear his favorite striped sweater vest to parties, which is
               less embarrassing than when he wears the orange furry one.[0m
[36m         LONG  There are different kinds of vests, including sweater vests, puffy winter vests, and tailored suit vests, usually worn underneath a formal jacket. Some vests
               have buttons, and others have zippers or snaps. Some are even bullet proof! When vest is a verb, it means to grant or bestow: "The Queen vests
               control of the zoos to the Royal Zookeeper." Both meanings of vest come from the same root word, the Latin vestire, "to clothe."[0m
