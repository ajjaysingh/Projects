[91m        SHORT  If you enjoy the vernal lushness of the landscape, that‚Äôs a kind of fancy way to say you like the way nature looks in the springtime.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word vernal entered English in the sixteenth century, tracing all the way back to the Latin word ver, meaning spring. Use the adjective vernal to describe
               something that occurs in springtime or is related to springtime. You might be familiar with the vernal equinox, which indicates the beginning
               of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The word vernal can also be used more broadly to describe something youthful or fresh ‚Äî springlike.[0m
