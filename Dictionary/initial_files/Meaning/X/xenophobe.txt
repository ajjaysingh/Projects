[91m        SHORT  Getting a job as a greeter with the United Nations is probably not the best career option for someone who suffers from xenophobia, a fear of foreigners or
               strangers.[0m
[36m         LONG  Xenophobia has its roots in fear — literally. Phobia comes from the Greek word meaning "fear." Given that the fear in question is of strangers, it makes sense
               that xeno- comes from the Greek word for — you guessed it — "stranger, foreigner." In the case of xenophobia, the fear is irrational. Someone
               who is xenophobic might distrust a neighbor he's never met, or a sheikh who lives halfway around the world. Xenophobia is like racism, but
               instead of fearing or distrusting people because of the color of their skin, you fear or distrust them because of their nationality, or because
               they are — or seem — foreign to you.[0m

	Wiki Definition:
              	Dictionary  definitions of xenophobia include: "deep-rooted fear towards foreigners" (Oxford English  Dictionary ; OED), and "fear of the unfamiliar"
               (Webster's). The word comes from the Ancient Greek words ξένος (xenos), meaning "strange", "foreigner", and φόβος (phobos), meaning "fear".
