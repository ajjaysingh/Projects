[91m        SHORT  An utterance is a bit of spoken language. It could be anything from "Ugh!" to a full sentence.[0m
[36m         LONG  To utter means "to say." So when you're saying something, you're making utterances. Saying "24" in math class is an utterance. A police officer yelling
               "Stop!" is an utterance. Saying "Good boy!" to your dog is an utterance. Even a long speech by the President is an utterance. If you can't hear
               it, it's not an utterance.[0m
