[91m        SHORT  If you're looking to relocate to a utopia, good luck! A utopia is an ideal society, and a scheme or vision for producing such a society can be called utopian.[0m
[36m         LONG  In 1516, the English philosopher Thomas More published Utopia, a book about an island nation with the perfect form of government. This novel gave us the
               adjective utopian, which  can be used to describe plans for or works of fiction depicting ideal societies. Dystopian literature, by contrast,
               describes nightmarishly repressive worlds. It's ironic that More himself may have conceived of his Utopia as a dystopia, or at least a satire.
               The name of More's novel is anglicized Greek for "no place" — which makes a lot of sense if you think about it.[0m
