[91m        SHORT  Undulate means to move in a wave-like pattern. If a sound increases and decreases in pitch or volume like waves, you can say the sound is undulating. When
               searching for the lost boy, the rescuers' cries undulated through the forest.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb undulate comes from the Latin word undula, which means "wavelet" (unda means "wave"). So any action shown with the verb undulate has that waving
               sense to it. If something moves in a wavy, pattern, for example, it is said to undulate. The wind might cause prairie grass to undulate, or
               music might cause hips to undulate.[0m
