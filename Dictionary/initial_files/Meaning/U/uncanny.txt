[91m        SHORT  If something is uncanny, it is so mysterious, strange, or unfamiliar that it seems supernatural. If you hear strange music echoing through your attic, you
               might refer to it as positively uncanny.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can also use uncanny to refer to something that is so remarkable that it is beyond what is natural: as in "uncanny abilities." This adjective was formed
               in English from the prefix un- "not" and canny "fortunate, safe." The current meaning of English canny is "careful and clever, especially in
               handling money."[0m
