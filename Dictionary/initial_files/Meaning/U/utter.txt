[91m        SHORT  The adjective utter is often used as an intensifier to mean "total" ‚Äî often with negative connotations (like "utter failure"). As a verb, the word has a
               totally unrelated meaning: to speak or to articulate a sound.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you utter something, you give it voice. You could utter a cry or utter complete sentences; either way, you are expressing yourself. However, if you declare
               someone an utter moron, you are saying he is a complete and total moron; not that he is a moron expressing himself. Don't confuse the spelling
               of utter with udder ‚Äî the latter is the part of the cow that you milk.[0m
