[91m        SHORT  If something is untenable, you can't defend it or justify it. If your disagreement with your teacher puts you in an untenable position, you better just admit
               you made a mistake and get on with it.[0m
[36m         LONG  When untenable entered English in the 17th century it meant "unable to be held against attack." That sense still holds true: you can use the adjective
               untenable to describe any situation, position, or theory that simply can't be defended. Untenable is a great word to use when you want to
               criticize something, whether it's a flawed system or a referee's bad call.[0m
