[91m        SHORT  Utopia is a perfect paradise that doesn’t exist, but which we all dream of anyway. In the dead of winter, we might imagine a utopia full of palm trees, warm
               breezes, and sun-soaked beaches.[0m
[36m         LONG  Utopia didn't evolve from Latin or another old foreign language. Author Thomas More actually created the noun in one of his books to describe an imaginary
               island where all systems—political, social, and legal—are perfect and operate harmoniously. The definition of utopia was later broadened to
               imply any perfect place. The opposite of utopia is dystopia, coined in 1868 by J.S. Mill to describe an “imaginary bad place.”[0m
