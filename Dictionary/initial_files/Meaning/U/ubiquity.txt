[91m        SHORT  It’s here, there, and everywhere! Ubiquity is the state of being everywhere all the time. Like a pop song that plays every place you go, or the ubiquity of
               mosquitoes in the summer or pollen in the spring. There’s no escape![0m
[36m         LONG  A god is a great example of ubiquity: an all-knowing deity that exists in every nook and cranny. The Latin root word ubique means “everywhere,” and something
               with ubiquity is indeed everywhere, impossible to avoid. Sometimes ubiquity is a mind trick, like learning that a group of crows is called a
               "murder," and then noticing crows everywhere you go, all day long. Wherever you go, you're reminded of the ubiquity of crows.[0m
