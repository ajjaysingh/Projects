[91m        SHORT  Zest is a kind of zeal or enthusiasm. If you've got a zest for something, you put your whole heart and soul into it. Dancers who have great zest leap, kick,
               and soar their way around the stage with a kind of joyful energy.[0m
[36m         LONG  Oddly enough, zest can also be the outer peel of a lemon or orange, which chefs scrape into their dishes when they want to add some tartness and tanginess to
               a recipe. People who live with that same kind of spice are said to have a "zest for life." In other words, they live their lives with a lot of
               flavor and gusto. A student who has a zest for learning dives into her books with an enjoyment and relish most people reserve for their
               wedding day.[0m
