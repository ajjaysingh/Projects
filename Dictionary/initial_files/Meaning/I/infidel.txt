[91m        SHORT  Infidel is a nasty way of referring to someone who does not follow the same religion you do.  How can you call people infidels and expect them to believe your
               religion is tolerant?[0m
[36m         LONG  Infidel comes to English from the Latin infidelis, which means "unfaithful," although it's almost always hurled at a person of different faith.  You can also
               use the word more lightly to mean someone who doesn't share a common belief or opinion.  Cries of "Infidel!" could be heard throughout the dorm
               when you announced that you didn't root for the local football team.[0m
