[91m        SHORT  Impiety is a disrespect for the sacred. For example, visitors are advised not to wear shorts or tank tops when touring certain churches and cathedrals in
               Europe, because doing so is viewed as impiety by those who worship there.[0m
[36m         LONG  English offers many options to describe disrespect. Impudence, insolence, sass, and irreverence are a few choices. Impiety sets itself apart from these in
               that it describes a lack of respect for a deity, like a god or God, or for worship itself. Piety is devotion or reverence, so impiety is a lack
               of devotion or reverence ‚Äî such as making fun of other people's religious beliefs.[0m
