[91m        SHORT  Something that's excessive or that goes way beyond normal limits is inordinate — like an overly obsessive love for chocolate or a fantasy football junkie who
               spends an inordinate amount of time checking his team.[0m
[36m         LONG  The adjective inordinate is the exact opposite of "reasonable" and "moderate." In fact, when you call something inordinate, you're saying it's downright
               exorbitant and out of proportion. It's often used to describe abnormal amounts of time spent doing something — playing video games at work or
               canoodling with your girlfriend at school, for example. But as Oscar Wilde once said, “An inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of
               remaining young.”[0m
