[91m        SHORT  When you're indignant, you're angry about an unfair situation. If you discovered that a teacher gave ten extra points on a test to all students who sat in the
               front row, you'd be indignant.[0m
[36m         LONG  Indignant is from Latin indignus "unworthy," and it refers to anger based on unworthy or unfair behavior rather than merely injury to one's own interests. You
               may be angry, even furious, if someone shoves you, but you are indignant if the shove is directed at someone weak or helpless.  The related
               noun is indignation, and something that arouses indignation is an indignity.[0m
