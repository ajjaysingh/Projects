[91m        SHORT  Some of the best kinds of parties are impromptu ones, when you decide at the last minute to get together. The adjective impromptu describes things done or
               said without previous thought or preparation.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impromptu is also used as an adverb: Most people are not able to speak impromptu in front of an audience. This word was borrowed from French, from Latin in
               pr≈çmpt≈´ "at hand, in readiness" from in "in" plus pr≈çmpt≈´, a form of pr≈çmptus "readiness," from pr≈çmere "to bring forth." As you can guess from
               the spelling, the adjective and verb prompt is related to impromptu; they are from the same Latin verb.[0m
