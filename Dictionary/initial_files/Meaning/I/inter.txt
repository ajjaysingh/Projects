[91m        SHORT  Inter means to bury, usually in a tomb or grave. If you loved your cat a lot, you might want to inter her remains in the back yard and make a nice little
               memorial.[0m
[36m         LONG  Most of the time, the word inter is going to be about burying someone or something. Often times, a family owns a plot of land in a cemetery where all family
               members are interred when they die. Occasionally, you might see it in the phrase "inter alia," a literary Latin expression meaning "among other
               things." Your professor is probably a poet and a scholar, inter alia.[0m
