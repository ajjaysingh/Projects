	Wiki Definition:
              	Infiltration  is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil.  Infiltration  rate in soil science is a measure of the rate at which soil
               is able to absorb rainfall or irrigation. It is measured in inches per hour or millimeters per hour. The rate decreases as the soil becomes
               saturated.
