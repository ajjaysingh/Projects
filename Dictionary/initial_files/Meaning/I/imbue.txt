[91m        SHORT  To imbue is to fill up with or become "soaked" in an idea or emotion, as a sponge takes in water. One visit to Africa might be enough to imbue ambitions in a
               medical student to return to heal the sick.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use imbue in a similar way as "saturate," or "soak through," to describe a filling or absorbing. A "hue" is a color, and it rhymes with imbue. When
               you're imbued with something, you are, in a way, colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from a spaghetti bowl, the
               color and the oil soak in. To fill people with qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or optimism.[0m
