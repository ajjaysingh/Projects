[91m        SHORT  An isthmus is a land bridge, a narrow strip of land that stretches across a body of water to connect two larger land masses.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Greek isthmos means "neck," so you can see how isthmus came to mean the connecting strip between land masses. If you look at an example, say the Isthmus
               of Panama, you can see how that neck-like bit of land separates the Caribbean Sea from the North Pacific Ocean as it connects North and South
               America. Think of an isthmus as kind of like a turkey neck that connects the bird's body and head (at least until Thanksgiving).[0m
