[91m        SHORT  An inquisition is a severe, harsh interrogation or questioning. When there's an inquisition, someone is doing everything possible to get to the bottom of
               something.[0m
[36m         LONG  While inquisitions are never a very positive experience, this word has even worse connotations thanks to the Spanish Inquisition, which hunted down and
               persecuted anyone who didn't believe in Catholicism. Today we use inquisition to describe any serious investigation, usually an illegal or
               immoral one. If your mom keeps hounding you with questions about school, your job, your love life ‚Äî you might yell, "What is this? An
               inquisition?"[0m
