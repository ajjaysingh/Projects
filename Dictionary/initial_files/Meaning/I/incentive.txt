[36m         LONG  This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum, from incentivus "stimulating." In Latin, incentivus meant "setting the tune," from
               incinere "to sing." The related English verb is incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early 1980s, and has been
               criticized as business jargon.[0m
