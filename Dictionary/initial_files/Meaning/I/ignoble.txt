[91m        SHORT  Ignoble means not noble, but for those of us that don‚Äôt live in feudal England and don‚Äôt worry about lords or peasants, ignoble just means base, or low, like

[36m         LONG  Ignoble means low, common, or humble, but we tend to use it to describe the lows of human nature, rather than economically humble people or places. So a
               picturesquely crumbing rustic cottage or a cool old diner is not ignoble, but perhaps a sketchy roadside bar is. Those that think that the
               human mind is the treasure of the world disdain ignoble animals like pigs or dogs‚Äì‚Äìafter all, they can‚Äôt compose lovely poems like we can.[0m
