[91m        SHORT  If something is slowly and secretly causing harm, it's insidious — like the rumors no one seems to listen to until suddenly someone's reputation is ruined.[0m
[36m         LONG  Insidious is related to the Latin noun, īnsidiae meaning "ambush" which comes from the Latin verb, īnsidēre "to lie in wait for." This is very fitting as an
               insidious rumor or problem is one whose negative effect is not realized until the damage is already done. Similarly, an insidious disease
               develops internally without symptoms, so that you don't realize right away that you are sick.[0m
