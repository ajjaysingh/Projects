[91m        SHORT  Use the verb incarcerate when you need to put someone behind bars in a big way, meaning, send them to prison, like those who, after being found guilty of a
               crime and sentenced, become incarcerated.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word incarcerate entered the English language in the sixteenth century, tracing back to the Latin word meaning “imprisoned.” If you incarcerate people,
               that means you imprison them for a predetermined amount of time in a jail, prison, or a detention center. It’s good to know the meaning of
               incarcerate, but make sure you never get so close to it that you have firsthand knowledge of the word.[0m
