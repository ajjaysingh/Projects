[91m        SHORT  "To be or not to be?" In his most famous line, Hamlet was using the infinitive form of the verb "be." The infinitive form of a verb is its most basic form,
               usually its "to" version.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word infinitive comes from the Latin infinitus meaning "unbounded, unlimited." When a verb is in its infinite form, it's not limited or bound by its
               subject or tense. Contrast "to be" with "was" ‚Äî was is tied to the past tense and a single person. Strip away the word to from "to be" and you
               have what's known as a bare infinitive. Keep the to there and you've got a full infinitive.[0m
