[36m         LONG  If you successfully inveigle your sister to doing something for you, she must be so caught up in your flattering that she is blind to your true intention. In
               fact, inveigle comes from the Middle French word aveugler, meaning “delude, make blind,” which can be traced back to the Medieval Latin word ab
               oculis, or “lacking eyes.” The people you inveigle don't see what you are really up to.[0m
