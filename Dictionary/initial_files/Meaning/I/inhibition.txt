[91m        SHORT  When you have inhibitions, you're self-conscious and maybe a little anxious. A shy child at a birthday party might have fun only after abandoning her

[36m         LONG  An inhibition is a force that prevents something from happening‚Äîand often comes from you yourself. Shy people are often said to suffer from inhibitions.  Some
               inhibitions are good, such as the one that prevents us from choking the life out of people we dislike. Other inhibitions, like the ones that
               prevent someone from ever enjoying himself, are not so great.[0m
