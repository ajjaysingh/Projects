[91m        SHORT  If you are hard up, broke, penniless, or strapped for cash, you could describe yourself as impecunious. Then maybe you could make some money teaching
               vocabulary words.[0m
[36m         LONG  Impecunious comes from the old Latin word for money, pecunia, combined with the prefix im, meaning not or without. But impecunious doesn’t just mean having no
               money. It means that you almost never have any money. If you go into the arts, you are most likely facing an impecunious future. If you gamble
               away your cash instead of saving it for rent, your landlord might throw you out for being impecunious.[0m
