[91m        SHORT  Imponderable describes a situation that isn't able to be completely explained. "Where did we come from?" is one of those imponderable questions that defy

               something that is elusive and vague, perhaps even evasive. When your question doesn't have a definitive answer, you are in imponderable
               territory: "Life has many imponderable questions, such as why you park in a driveway and drive on parkway."[0m
