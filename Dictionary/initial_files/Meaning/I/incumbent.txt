[36m         LONG  Incumbent comes from the Latin word incumbens, which means lying in or leaning on, but came to mean holding a position. It was first used in English for
               someone holding a church office, and then someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for political officials. In a race for
               mayor, the incumbent mayor faces a challenger. Incumbent also means obligation. It is incumbent upon you to do the dishes.[0m
