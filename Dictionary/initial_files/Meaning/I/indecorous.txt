[91m        SHORT  Indecorous behavior isn't proper or socially acceptable. It would be indecorous to publish your sister's diary in the newspaper or to tell your extended
               family an offensive joke at Thanksgiving dinner.[0m
[36m         LONG  Rude or off-color remarks are indecorous, and wearing a bikini to a formal dinner would also be indecorous. Indecorous things lack decorum, which is good
               manners or proper behavior. Indecorous, from the Latin decorus, "becoming or seemly," comes from the root word decus, "ornament," and is
               related to words like "decorate" and "decent."[0m
