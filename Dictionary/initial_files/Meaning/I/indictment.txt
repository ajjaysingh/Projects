[91m        SHORT  An indictment, or a legal document charging you with a crime, is something you don't want to be the recipient of, so try not to rob any banks or start any
               money laundering schemes, and you'll probably be okay.[0m
[36m         LONG  An indictment is most frequently a charge of a serious crime. You may have heard on television legal programs the phrase "on the first count of the
               indictment," which means that there's more than one charge of a category of crime in the indictment. The word can also be used more informally
               to mean an accusation. A book or article detailing the wrongdoing of a person or industry may be said to be an indictment of that person or
               industry.[0m
