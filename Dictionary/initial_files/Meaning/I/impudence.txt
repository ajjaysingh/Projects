[91m        SHORT  When you show impudence, you lack shame about your rude behavior. Examples of impudence? Not tipping the waiter, sticking your tongue out, tripping your
               grandmother ‚Äî you get the picture.[0m
[36m         LONG  The noun impudence is derived from the Latin impudentia, "shamelessness." Being rude is a main trait of impudence; another is doing something you're not
               supposed to do ‚Äî usually with an attitude that shows you don't care. When you are acting with impudence, you are usually overstepping your
               boundaries ‚Äî like a kid who challenges his parents and can't accept "Because I said so!" as a reason for discipline.[0m
