	Wiki Definition:
              	Infructuous  is a word that is not used very often by native speakers of English, it is however quite popular among newspaper reporters in India. First, let
               me deal with the pronunciation of the word. The u in the second syllable sounds like the u in but, cut, and hut. The following tu is like the
               tue in Tuesday.
