[91m        SHORT  Inchoate means just beginning to form. You can have an inchoate idea, like the earliest flickers of images for your masterpiece, or an inchoate feeling, like
               your inchoate sense of annoyance toward your sister's new talking parrot.[0m
[36m         LONG  Inchoate comes from a Latin word for beginning. When something is inchoate, although you donтАЩt yet understand what it is fully, you have a strong sense that
               it is indeed coming. ItтАЩs stronger than the wisp of an idea that never turns into anything. But itтАЩs hard to really find the language to
               describe an inchoate idea. ThatтАЩs the whole point: you donтАЩt have the words for it yet![0m
