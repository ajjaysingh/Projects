[91m        SHORT  Indifference is the trait of lacking interest or enthusiasm in things. When you feel indifference for something, you neither like it nor dislike it.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you are a person who feels a lot of indifference, you probably say "eh," a lot. You just don't care much. Indifference can be compared to apathy, which
               means "lack of concern," though apathy is a little stronger: Apathy means you don't care whether your friends call you; indifference means you
               don't care what movie you end up seeing ‚Äî you don't have a strong preference for any of the choices.[0m
