[36m         LONG  Imminent is from Latin imminere "to overhang," and to say that something is imminent is to say that it is hanging over you and about to fall, in a
               metaphorical way. If you take your mom‚Äôs car and drive it into the mailbox, getting grounded is imminent. You don‚Äôt want that hanging over your
               head![0m
