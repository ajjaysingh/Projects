[91m        SHORT  To be impenitent, is to have no remorse or regrets. Try not to be impenitent about that pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream you ate in one sitting. Everyone
               deserves a treat once in a while![0m
[36m         LONG  When you repent, you're regretting or feeling sorry about something you've done. But take its root word penitire meaning "to regret" and slap the suffix im-
               meaning "not" in front of it and you've got the opposite: impenitent, or "to not regret." A murderer who is impenitent about his crime feels no
               shame about what he's done.[0m
