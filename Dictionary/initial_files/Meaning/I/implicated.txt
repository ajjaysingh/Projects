[91m        SHORT  Someone who is implicated in something is shown to be somehow involved in it. The word is often used in a negative sense, suggesting an involvement in
               something wrong, with the person being implicated by the facts of the case.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin word implicātus, which means "folded in," is the past participle of implicāre, meaning to interweave ideas or objects. In the 17th century, the word
               referred to a general entanglement in a complicated situation. By 1797, the definition had come to focus on the idea of criminal involvement,
               suggesting someone "folded in," or involved, in a crime or scandal. Today, the word implicated is not necessarily tied to crime, but it's
               generally negative.[0m
