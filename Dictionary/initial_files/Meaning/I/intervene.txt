[91m        SHORT  From the Latin "intervenire," meaning “to come between,” the verb intervene means just that: to get involved, to jump in the middle of something, to
               interfere.[0m
[36m         LONG  The verb intervene was first recorded around 1600. Since then there haven't been many interventions in its meaning or usage. You should probably intervene in
               a heated verbal fight between two of your friends before it escalates and gets physical. Especially if they're debating the United States’
               habit of intervening in international conflicts.[0m
