[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective transient to describe something that always changes or moves around. If your older brother is constantly moving from city to city, you can
               say he's transient.[0m
[36m         LONG  Transient is most often used to modify nouns like nature, threat, source and cause, which suggests that the word  often shows up in formal contexts, like
               analysis of finance or global terrorism. But it can also be used for anything that moves quickly from one thing to another, like a transient
               feeling or facial expression. Transient is also a noun meaning "a person who moves from place to place; a homeless person." The word comes from
               Latin transire, "to pass over," so you can think of it as describing things that are quickly passed over.[0m
