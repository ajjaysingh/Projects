[91m        SHORT  Things that are tacky are cheap, flashy, garish, gaudy, loud, tawdry, or trashy. Tacky clothes are a fashion nightmare, and tacky comments are embarrassing

               showy — obnoxious. When people make tasteless, trashy comments, it's also considered tacky. But if you're in art class and someone says that
               your paper-mâché project is tacky, don't get mad — they probably just mean that it's not dry yet and still sticky to the touch.[0m
