[36m         LONG  You might hear the adjective tumultuous in news stories about riots because it's one of the best words to describe a group of people in turmoil or disorder,
               but it can mean anything in a state of unrest. For example, you might steer your boat into a safe harbor before a heavy storm, so the
               tumultuous waves won't sweep you onto the rocks.[0m
