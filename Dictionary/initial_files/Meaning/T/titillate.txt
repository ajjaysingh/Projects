[91m        SHORT  A juicy steak may titillate your taste buds, or sexy images in a foreign film may titillate your desire. Titillate means to excite someone's imagination,
               especially in a sexual way.[0m
[36m         LONG  Titillate comes from a Latin verb that means "tickle," and that's what something that titillates does to the imagination. Today's media bombard you with
               images made to titillate, from video game heroines with extreme physiques to casual nudity on prime-time TV. But it doesn't have to be sex to
               titillate. A display of fabulous pastries in a bakery window can titillate your senses, or whispered rumors about your high school principal's
               past life as a rodeo queen may titillate your curiosity.[0m
