[91m        SHORT  Use the adjective transitive when you're talking about a verb that needs both a subject and at least one object, like "give" in this sentence: "I will give
               you a cupcake if you're really nice."[0m
[36m         LONG  You're only going to hear the word transitive in a grammar lesson, although you probably use transitive verbs all the time. While an intransitve verb, like to
               die, doesn't need an object — you can say "My dog died," for example — a transitive verb has a direct object upon which an action is performed.
               This grammatical meaning has been in use since the 1500s.[0m
