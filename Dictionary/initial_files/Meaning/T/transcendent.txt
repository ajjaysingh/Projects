[91m        SHORT  Transcendent describes something so excellent that it's beyond the range of human understanding.[0m
[36m         LONG  Transcendent shares the prefix trans, meaning "across," with many familiar words such as transport (carry across), transcontinental (across a continent), and
               transparent (light shines across). Transcendental meditation carries people across to a higher consciousness. So something transcendent goes
               across boring reality into super awesomeness in a world all its own. It moves you. Angels are transcendent, and even your favorite novel can be
               transcendent. Beware of someone who finds the cheesecake transcendent; she may tend to exaggerate.[0m
