[91m        SHORT  A talisman is a charm that is supposed to ward off evil or illness. Your rabbit's foot key chain may be your lucky talisman. Of course, it wasn't so lucky for
               that rabbit.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word talisman has been around in English since the 1630s and it has roots in both Arabic and Greek words. A talisman is usually worn around the neck but
               could exist in other forms, like a ring or inscribed stone. You can think of a talisman as a good luck charm, but people tend to take talismans
               more seriously — as if they are empowered with magic to ward off evil spirits.[0m
