[91m        SHORT  Toil is another word for work. You toil as a customer service rep all day, but you'd prefer to work as a rock goddess. Unfortunately, there weren't many ads
               in the employment section for goddesses ‚Äî rock or otherwise.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although toil means "work" (in both its noun and verb forms), it usually has the added meaning of hard work, especially physical labor.  If you'd lived during
               the Great Depression, you might have toiled on roadwork and conservation projects. Your toils would have created roads in the Great Smoky
               Mountains National Park, for example.  Thanks for all your hard work!  Now, relax and enjoy the scenery.[0m
