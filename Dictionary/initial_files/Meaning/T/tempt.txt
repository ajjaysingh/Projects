[36m         LONG  The verb tempt often has negative implications: "Don't let those bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!" When something tempts you, it's often with
               the knowledge that it's not the best idea, however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a religious term, meaning "to entice to evil or
               sin," while today it's more likely to be a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.[0m
