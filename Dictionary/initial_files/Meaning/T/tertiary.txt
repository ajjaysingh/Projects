[91m        SHORT  Tertiary is another way of saying "third in importance," like socializing with co-workers being a tertiary reason for getting an after-school job ‚Äî less

               Tertiary period marks the beginning of life for mammals, and in the United Kingdom, tertiary education means "college-level."[0m
