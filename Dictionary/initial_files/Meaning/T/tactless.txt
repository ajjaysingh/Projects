[36m         LONG  Since people with tact are polite and respectful, tactless people are the opposite: rude and ill-mannered. Interrupting is tactless. Wearing a baseball hat in
               church is tactless. Not holding the door for someone is tactless. This word has to do with other graces besides social graces too. Being clumsy
               or lacking in judgment can also be called tactless, and an employee who constantly botches his job and never understands why is also tactless.[0m
