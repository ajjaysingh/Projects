[91m        SHORT  Rampant means wild, out of control, to be up on your hind legs roaring at the world. You don't have to be four-legged: "The children ran rampant at the

               mode, or like wild plants such as the kudzu that ran rampant over an old barn until the entire thing was covered. There can also be rampant
               wildfires that destroy houses in the Southwest, or robots that run rampant in the lab after the janitor accidentally sets them free.[0m
