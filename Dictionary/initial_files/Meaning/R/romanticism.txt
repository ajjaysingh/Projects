[91m        SHORT  Movies that present emotional stories of love, terror, and rescue, appeal to your sense of romanticism. Highly-charged situations of love and loss allow you
               to escape reality for a little while.[0m
[36m         LONG  The suffix ism indicates a condition, so romanticism is the condition of being romantic, or yearning for the imaginative and adventurous.  The word originally
               meant "of the Roman style," and referred to using Romance languages rather than the Frankish, or Germanic. It then came to mean Medieval tales
               of knightly chivalry, and later included love stories. In the late 18th Century, Romanticism became a major artistic movement, infusing art,
               music, and literature with the emotional cores of adventure and love.[0m
