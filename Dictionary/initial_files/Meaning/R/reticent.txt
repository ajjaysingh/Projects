[91m        SHORT  Reticent means either quiet or restrained. If you're reticent about your feelings, you like to keep them to yourself, and you're probably quiet in rowdy
               groups where everyone is talking over each other.[0m
[36m         LONG  The original meaning of reticent describes someone who doesn‚Äôt like to talk. Be careful in your context, however. Reticent can refer to someone who is
               restrained and formal, but it can also refer to someone who doesn‚Äôt want to draw attention to herself or who prefers seclusion to other people.
               Don‚Äôt confuse reticent with reluctant, which means unwilling.[0m
