[36m         LONG  If you've ever had an argument with someone and then made up, you have reconciled. Reconcile is a verb that can mean "to become resigned" like if you're
               reconciled to getting the bottom bunk when you wanted the top. It also means to "bring into agreement and harmony." Words like it are pacify,
               harmonize, and accommodate â€” reconcile is definitely an agreeable word![0m
