[36m         LONG  The House of Representatives has a couple of ways to punish naughty members. One way is to reprimand them by voting to express disapproval. In 2009,
               Representative Joe Wilson was reprimanded after his outburst of "You lie!" during President Obama's speech. In the halls of Congress, this is
