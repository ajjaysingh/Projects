[91m        SHORT  Righteousness is a feeling or way of life that is all about doing the right thing: righteousness shows great concern for morals and ethics.[0m
[36m         LONG  Righteousness may sound like an old-fashioned word, but it's a timeless concept. As you can tell from seeing the word right, this is a word about taking a
               stand and doing the right thing. Trying to help poor, oppressed people is a cause full of righteousness. Doing an unpopular thing that is
               ethical requires righteousness. People like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela definitely walked the path of righteousness.[0m
