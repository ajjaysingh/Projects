[91m        SHORT  If someone asks you to make a difficult decision ‚Äî like what to have for dinner ‚Äî it might lead to rumination, or a long period of deep thought.[0m
[36m         LONG  Use the noun rumination when there's thoughtful consideration going on. If your grandfather answers every question by saying, "Hmm. Let me think about that,"
               he is a fan of rumination. It comes from the verb ruminate, which means "to think deeply," but also means "to chew the cud." Both words come
               from the Latin word ruminatus, which has the same meaning and which is rooted in rumen, or "gullet."[0m
