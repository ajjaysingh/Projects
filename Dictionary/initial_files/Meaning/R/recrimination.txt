[91m        SHORT  Sometimes you accuse your opponent of refusing to compromise and he accuses you of the same thing. That’s a recrimination, an accusation or insult that’s
               hurled back at someone.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you’ve ever been in a verbal disagreement with someone, odds are that you’ve experienced recriminations.  You can remember it by noticing that crim as in
               "crime" is part of the word. When recriminations fly back and forth between two sides, each accuses the other of crimes in the metaphorical
               sense. Once the emergencies of a disaster have been taken care of, recriminations are sometimes hurled at those in charge for the way the
               crisis was handled.[0m
