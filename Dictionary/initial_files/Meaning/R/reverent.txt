[91m        SHORT  When you have great awe and respect for someone or something, and you show it by respectfully worshiping that person, thing, deity, or musical group, you are
               being reverent.[0m
[36m         LONG  Originally, the word reverent was used only in religious contexts, but now it works when people are just acting like they‚Äôre in a religious setting (even if
               the object of their worship is a sports star or political pundit). People are occasionally reverent in regard to antique cars, supermodels,
               spelling bee champions and giant TV screens.  Reverent is related to the verb revere, which is also about having or showing respect for someone
               or something.[0m
