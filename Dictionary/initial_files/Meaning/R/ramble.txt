[91m        SHORT  You ramble when your talking or your walking goes on and on and on. And on. You‚Äôre in no hurry to make a point or get to your destination ‚Äî if there is one at
               all.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word ramble comes from similar roots as roam. They both mean wander, but they‚Äôre often used a little differently. You might roam around on vacation to
               relax or find adventure. If you‚Äôre a shark, you roam the deep sea for food. On the other hand, if the person on the plane next to you chatters
               nervously and can‚Äôt stop, you wish they wouldn‚Äôt ramble on like that.[0m
