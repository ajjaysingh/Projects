[91m        SHORT  Reminisce is a dreamy way of saying "remember the past." If you're swapping old stories with friends and remembering all the silly things you used to do, then
               you're reminiscing.[0m
[36m         LONG  Reminiscing is all about happy recollections and thinking back to stories from the past. It's hard to reminisce about the old days with someone you don't know
               very well or haven't known very long, since a key part of reminiscing is a shared history. But just about anyone can reminisce about going
               elementary school, learning to tie shoelaces, or getting that first job.[0m
