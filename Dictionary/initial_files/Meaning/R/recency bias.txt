	Wiki Definition:
              	" Recency bias " is the phenomenon of a person most easily remembering something that has happened recently, compared to remembering something that may have
               occurred a while back.


When things suck, when you're deep in it, it seems like they will suck forever. you can't imagine a way out. When things are great, you live as if it'll always last.


Recency Bias is where stock market participants evaluate their portfolio performance based on recent results or on their perspective of recent results and make incorrect conclusions that ultimately lead to incorrect decisions about how the stock market behaves.
