[91m        SHORT  Use the noun raillery to describe a kind of joking or gentle teasing. There will probably be a bit of raillery between elementary school students on a field

[36m         LONG  If you engage in raillery, you make fun of someone ‚Äî but lightheartedly, not in a way that would cause offense. The raillery between good friends or siblings
               might include laughter and teasing, or a joking banter back and forth. To rail is to complain, although its Middle French root, railler, means
               "to tease or joke," possibly from the Old Proven√ßal word ralhar, "to scoff or to joke."[0m
