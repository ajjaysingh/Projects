[91m        SHORT  Resuscitation is the action of bringing someone back to consciousness. Ambulance workers are skilled at resuscitation.[0m
[36m         LONG  To resuscitate is to revive someone who has passed out: this act is called resuscitation. If someone needs resuscitation, something serious has happened — the
               person has lost consciousness and may be on the verge of death. You've probably heard of "mouth-to-mouth resuscitation," which is one method of
               reviving. Medical professionals have many other techniques and gadgets that aid resuscitation. The Latin root word is resuscitare, "rouse
               again, or revive," from re and suscitare, "to raise."[0m
