[91m        SHORT  A reprisal is an act of retaliation, especially one committed by one country against another. If you attack your enemy's village and cause lots of damage,
               expect a reprisal.[0m
[36m         LONG  Reprisal comes from the French for taking back, and used to mean the seizure of property as a compensation for some earlier loss. Now we use it more in the
               sense of a retaliatory attack.  When Germany bombed London during World War II, the British reprisals included the bombing of Berlin. Reprisal
               doesn't always have to be about war; you can use it for any act of retaliation.[0m
