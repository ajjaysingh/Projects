[91m        SHORT  A realm is an area that is ruled by something. If you are a controlling cook who doesn‚Äôt like anyone to do anything else in the kitchen, then the kitchen is

[36m         LONG  Realm comes from the French for kingdom, but since there aren‚Äôt so many kings or queens left in the world, you‚Äôll more often find it referring to non-royal
               spheres. That could be the sphere of a special kind of knowledge, like the realm of biology, or the political realm. Or it could be an area
               dominated by some group. Little Italy was famously the realm of the mafia; Hollywood is the realm of film stars.[0m
