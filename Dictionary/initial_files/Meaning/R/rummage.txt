[91m        SHORT  Rummage means to search for something, but in a scattered, disorganized manner. You can rummage through your drawer looking for a lost sock, or you could even
               hold "a rummage sale" to sell off all your socks that are missing their mates.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ahoy, mateys: the word rummage hails from a sea-faring background. The Middle Dutch ruim, Germanic rum, and Old English rum all referred to a compartment on a
               ship, probably stemming from the Middle French verb arrumer, "to stow goods in the hold of a ship." The idea of rummaging as searching was
               first recorded in the 1620s. The first rummage sale also had its ship connection, as it was a sale on the docks of unclaimed items.[0m
