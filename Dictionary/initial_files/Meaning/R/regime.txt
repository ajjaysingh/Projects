[36m         LONG  Regime takes its militaristic and government feel from the Latin word regimen "to rule." A political regime has a negative association to it that makes you
               think of totalitarian governments. How did it come to mean "diet" or "program of exercise" as well? If you are put on a regime of exercise and
               healthy eating, you are ordered by a doctor to do these things and it probably feels like you're being ruled sometimes![0m
