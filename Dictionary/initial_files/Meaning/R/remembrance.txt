[36m         LONG  The noun remembrance is really just another way to say "memory." It's the process of remembering things that happened in the past. In Shakespeare's play
               "Hamlet," the character of Ophelia famously says, "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance." The smell of the herb has actually been shown to
               improve memory, and has historically been a symbol of remembrance. Early uses of remembrance had the meaning "keepsake or souvenir."[0m
