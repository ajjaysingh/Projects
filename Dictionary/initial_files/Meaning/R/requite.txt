[91m        SHORT  You can requite a friend‚Äôs kindness by doing your friend a favor or by being kind in return. Requite means "to repay or return."[0m
[36m         LONG  To requite something is to return it. However, saying that you want to requite a gift means that you want to give something in return for it ‚Äî not that you
               want to return the gift to the store for some quick cash. Requite is often used in the context of love; if you requite someone‚Äôs love, you love
               that person back. Requite can also be used in a negative sense. Someone who wants to requite an injury wants payback for it.[0m
