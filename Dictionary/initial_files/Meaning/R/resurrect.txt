[36m         LONG  If you've ever seen someone bring a dead person back to life in a science fiction or fantasy movie, you saw them resurrect someone. Turning someone into a
               zombie or vampire is a type of resurrecting, and in the Bible Jesus resurrects Lazurus. Also, this word can apply to any kind of revival. A
               song can resurrect faded memories. A forgotten project can be resurrected if you start it up again. Resurrecting always involves bringing
               something back to life.[0m
