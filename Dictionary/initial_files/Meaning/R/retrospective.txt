[91m        SHORT  Retrospective means looking back. An art exhibit that cover an artist's entire career is called a retrospective because it looks back at the work the artist
               has produced over many years.[0m
[36m         LONG  Retro- means back, -spect- means look (think: spectacles), so the word means literally 'a looking back.' Many people take a retrospective look at their lives
               on birthdays or on New Year's Eve to evaluate events and see how well they've met their goals. You could call the yearly evaluation you get
               from your boss a retrospective review of your work.[0m
