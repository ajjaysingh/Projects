[36m         LONG  The repeating, often low, booming sound that follows the strum of an electric guitar or the thump of a drumstick on a cymbal is called reverberation. It's
               frequently described as sound that lingers beyond the original noise. You can also use the word to describe something else that lingers, like a
               feeling or an effect: "The reverberations of the war lasted for decades." Originally, reverberation was "reflection of light or heat," from the
               Old French reverberacion, "great flash of light."[0m
