[91m        SHORT  When you raise a ruckus you make a lot of noise. A ruckus can be the sound of an argument, the noise of soccer fans celebrating a victory, or it could be two-

[36m         LONG  Ruckus sounds like what it means ‚Äî loud and maybe a little rowdy. A ruckus is the uproar you cause when you noisily protest the new cafeteria menu or a bad
               call against your favorite team. Cats fighting outside your window in the middle of the night could also cause a ruckus. You can also raise a
               quiet ruckus with your letters to the editor or silent sit-ins that instantly go viral.[0m
