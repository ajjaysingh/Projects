[91m        SHORT  A ravenous person feels like they haven't eaten in days and could probably finish off 10 pizzas without help. So ravenous is not a good state to be in when
               you go grocery shopping.[0m
[36m         LONG  Back in the early 15th century, you would have been called ravenous if you were greedy and obsessed with stealing, much like a pirate. Nowadays, it‚Äôs often
               used to describe extreme hunger or desire. Having a ravenous appetite means you're literally hungry like the wolf, snarling and growling
               (stomach) included. So do everyone in the lunchroom a favor and remember to eat breakfast.[0m
