[91m        SHORT  To recapitulate means to go back and summarize. At the end of an oral report, you might say, "So, to recapitulate, I've made three points," and then you name

[36m         LONG  Recapitulate is a long, scary-looking word that actually means something simple and easy. It comes from the Latin re- "again" and capitulum "chapter," which
               comes from the word caput "head." Think of recapitulating––or recapping, for short––as putting nice little caps on all the bottles you've
               opened up––tightening everything up.[0m
