[36m         LONG  Romance comes from Roman, and first meant a story translated into French from Latin (the common language of old Rome), usually about the amorous adventures of
               chivalrous knights, which is how romances came to be associated with love stories. Now it's used to mean a love relationship, in a story or
               not. The Romance languages are those derived from Latin. If you romance a tale, you exaggerate it, and if you romance a person, you're making
               advances.[0m
