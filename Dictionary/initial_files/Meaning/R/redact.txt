[91m        SHORT  To redact is to arrange or edit text in a written document. Don't get too attached to every word in your rough draft; your teacher will expect you to redact
               it before handing in your final paper.[0m
[36m         LONG  Redact refers to any kind revising or editing that makes a document better, usually for publication. When you see the prefix re-, you know the word is going
               to refer to something either being done again or retracted. You can think of redact as redoing writing or taking back some of what was
               originally said.  You'll often see the word redact being used with the prepositions  in or into. You might take several documents and redact
               them into a single one.[0m
