[91m        SHORT  When you politely refuse your neighbor’s offer of remuneration for your efforts with the lawn, you may have made a mistake. Remuneration refers to payment for
               a service, so the neighbor was basically offering you cash.[0m
[36m         LONG  If it makes you uncomfortable to talk about your wages, you can use the word remuneration instead — the word has a remote sound to it that makes it seem like
               you aren’t talking about money even though you are. It’s a formal way to refer to payment for work or other services. You might see this word
               in contracts, policies, and other official documents that refer to payments.[0m
