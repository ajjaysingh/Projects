[91m        SHORT  If something is reviled, you alone don‚Äôt dislike it; a whole community of like-minded souls has to hate its guts. For instance, spam is widely reviled. (The
               junk e-mails, not the potted meat. Somebody out there really does like that potted meat.)[0m
[36m         LONG  If you‚Äôre the only one who hates, say, your math teacher, it‚Äôs not fair to say that person is reviled. If she is majestically unpopular with the entire senior
               class and is routinely the butt of geometry-themed insults, well then sadly, this instructor is indeed reviled.  Generally, when someone or
               something is reviled, much of the poison aimed is in print, such as critical reviews or insulting editorials.[0m
