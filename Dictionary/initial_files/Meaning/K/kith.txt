[36m         LONG  It's very rare to see the word kith unless it's accompanied by the word kin, or "relations." The phrase "kith and kin" means "friends and family." If every
               actor in your local community theater's production of "The Sound of Music" invites his or her kith and kin, the seats will be full on opening
               night. Kith comes from the Old English cy√∞√∞, which means "kinfolk, neighbors," and also "home, knowledge, and acquaintance."[0m
