[91m        SHORT  A kiosk is a small booth or stall. Shopping malls and airports have retail kiosks that sell all sorts of things, ranging from cookies to cell phones to
               sunglasses to perfumes to newspapers to . . . well, really almost anything![0m
[36m         LONG  You're probably familiar with retail kiosks, since they always seem to be located in highly visible areas of the mall, but there are other types of kiosks as
               well. Information kiosks provide helpful items to tourists, such as maps and pamphlets. You might also see electronic kiosks where you can buy
               tickets or get various types of information through videos or interactive presentations.[0m
