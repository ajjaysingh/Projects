[91m        SHORT  You experience a knee jerk when your doctor taps your knee with a rubber mallet and your leg automatically kicks out. The idiom "a knee jerk reaction" means
               that you respond to something in an equally unthinking way.[0m
[36m         LONG  If you instinctively assume that someone who loves clowns wouldn't have much in common with you, that's a knee jerk, or automatic, reaction. This figurative
               meaning of knee jerk came from the physical reflex ‚Äî which is called a "patellar reflex" by doctors, and which was discovered and named in the
               1870's.[0m
