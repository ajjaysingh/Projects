[91m        SHORT  The bosom is the breast or chest area of the body. It is also poetically considered to be the place where our feelings reside.[0m
[36m         LONG  Used as a verb or noun, bosom originates from the Old English word bosm, meaning "breast, womb, surface, or ship's hold." It is commonly used as a polite
               reference to a woman's breasts. Because our bosom (chest) contains our heart, it has also become known as the place where our feelings,
               intuitions, or secret thoughts are kept. Close friends are sometimes called "bosom buddies."[0m
