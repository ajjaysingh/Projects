[91m        SHORT  A biopsy is a sample of tissue or liquid from the body that helps determine if you have a disease.  If your doctor finds a lump in part of your body, she will
               probably do a biopsy to see if it is cancerous or not.[0m
[36m         LONG  Bios means life and opsis means see, so a biopsy is a way for a doctor to look into your body, so to speak, by taking a sample of it. There are different
               kinds of biopsies, depending on where the tissue is that your doctor needs to look at. You might have a surgical biopsy or a less invasive
               biopsy by needle.[0m
