[91m        SHORT  To blather is to talk on and on without saying anything very important or wise. If you blather all afternoon, it might be a welcome distraction to your friend
               who's grieving the death of her cat.[0m
[36m         LONG  You can use the word blather as a noun too: you might hate riding the bus home from school because of all the silly blather around you. At a job, it might be
               acceptable to blather during your lunch break, but not once you get back to work. The verb came first, and it was originally Scottish, probably
               from the Old Norse word blaÃ°ra, "mutter or wag the tongue."[0m
