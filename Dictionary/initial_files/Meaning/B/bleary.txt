[91m        SHORT  Something that's bleary is dull, tired, or unfocused. Your eyes might be too bleary first thing in the morning to focus on the newspaper — at least before

[36m         LONG  Bleary almost always describes a person's eyes, although you can also use it simply to mean blurred or exhausted. A day spent traveling from Asia to North
               America can leave you with bleary eyes, and so can a night of crying after the death of your beloved dog. The word bleary comes from a now-
