[91m        SHORT  A person, object, or situation that's bizarre is very odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walked into class wearing a purple
               boa, lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, "How bizarre!"[0m
[36m         LONG  Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro "angry, fierce, strange," from
               Spanish, "bold, like a knight." The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque bizar "a beard," since beards were taken as signs of energy
               and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre — like when your
               teacher conducts a lesson in Pig Latin.[0m
