[91m        SHORT  Brash sounds like what it means: harsh, loud, and maybe a little rude. Sometimes that‚Äôs good, like when you have a serious rash on your face and give Aunt
               Nell a brash warning before she showers you with kisses.[0m
[36m         LONG  There's nothing warm and fuzzy about brash. New Yorkers are sometimes thought of as the poster children for brash behavior: they can be bold and brazen. Pushy
               even. You might find brashness offensive, or maybe you think it's refreshingly direct. If you're a cab driver, a tough exterior might be
               useful, but being brash probably won‚Äôt advance your career if you work in a hotel, where you‚Äôre supposed to be polite and welcoming.[0m
