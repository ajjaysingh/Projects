[91m        SHORT  A blight is a disease that hurts plants and makes their leaves wither. It can also affect neighborhoods. Urban blight refers to a part of the city where
               things are falling apart.[0m
[36m         LONG  Blight rhymes with bright, but it‚Äôs the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a
               blight. In 1845, more than a third of the potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on
               potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a blight
               makes people ‚Äî or plants ‚Äî fight for their lives.[0m
