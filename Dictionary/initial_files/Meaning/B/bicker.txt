[91m        SHORT  When you bicker, you argue in a petty way, like two kids squabbling in the backseat on a long car trip, or politicians taking cheap shots at each other but
               avoiding discussion of important issues.[0m

               you've listened for years to your ill-tempered aunt from Boise bicker with your uncle from Dubuque over how the Thanksgiving turkey should be
               carved, you might want to book a trip to Tierra del Fuego and avoid the holiday altogether.[0m
