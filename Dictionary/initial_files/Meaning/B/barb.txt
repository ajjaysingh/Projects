[91m        SHORT  Whether it is a spike on the wire atop a security fence or a mean remark someone said about you, a barb can hurt. When you encounter either kind of barb, you

[36m         LONG  Barb comes from the Latin word barba, which means ‚Äúbeard.‚Äù Beards offer protection from things like cold and wind, but as Mommy found out when she kissed
               Santa Claus, they can also be quite scratchy. Perhaps this is why, when it comes to talking about beards, some people speak nothing but barbs.[0m
