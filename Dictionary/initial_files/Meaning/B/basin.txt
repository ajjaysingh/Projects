[36m         LONG  You can think of basinas something shaped like a bowl. If you're going for an old-fashioned ring, say "wash basin." If you‚Äôre in England, you might use a
               basin for cooking. The word basin also has various geological senses, particularly a depression in the ground or ocean floor. A basin is also
               the spot where a river drains ‚Äî like the famed Mississippi River Basin. That‚Äôs one big bowl![0m
