[91m        SHORT  If you bar a college student from entering a bar because he's too young to drink, it means that you prevent him from going into an establishment that serves

[36m         LONG  Bar is one of those handy words with many different meanings. There's the kind of bar where you order coffee or a drink. There is also the bar that a
               bartender keeps close at hand in case she needs a weapon when patrons get rowdy ‚Äî like a long piece of metal. And when you bar something, you
               make it inaccessible in some way. The word bar comes from the French word barre, which means "beam, gate, or barrier."[0m
