[91m        SHORT  A barge is a big, flat boat that can transport heavy goods over water. You might see a barge carrying a load of new cars down a river.[0m
[36m         LONG  Barges are useful for moving very heavy things along canals and rivers. A typical barge can hold more than a thousand tons of cargo, so it's ideal for bulky,
               weighty goods. Barge is also a verb, meaning both "move by barge" and "shove forward," as when you barge in the door of a crowded party or
               barge into your brother's room just to bother him. The root is believed to be the Greek baris, "Egyptian boat."[0m
