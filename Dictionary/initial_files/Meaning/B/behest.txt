[91m        SHORT  Behest is an authoritative command or request. If your boss or principal asks to see you, you go to their office at their behest.[0m
[36m         LONG  Behest rhymes with "request" and they almost mean the same thing, if you give your request a little authoritative oomph, just a tad bit of "or else." Another
               difference between these words is that you can't use behest as a verb: You can't behest someone. You act according to their behest. The root
               word here is the Old English hehaes, means "a vow."[0m
