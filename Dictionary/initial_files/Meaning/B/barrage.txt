[91m        SHORT  A barrage is something that comes quickly and heavily — as an attack of bullets or artillery, or a fast spray of words.[0m
[36m         LONG  Sometimes in movies or news footage, the audience gets a glimpse from behind a mounted weapon and sees a heavy rain of bombs or bullets — called a barrage —
               going toward a target, sending as much POW! as possible to hit a wide area. Words become a barrage when spoken or written in uncontrollable
               anger or with overflowing emotion: "Her human-rights speech was a barrage of passion. It was hard to keep up with, but we felt the intensity of
               her cause."[0m
