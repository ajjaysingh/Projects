[91m        SHORT  A bristle is a stiff hair â€” the kind men shave off their face or the kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an animal rights
               activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and you'll get the idea.[0m
[36m         LONG  The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs â€” the ones that stand up on the
               neck or along the back of animal when it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another name for such erectile
               animal hairs. Thus the saying "to get one's hackles up," which is pretty much identical to bristling.[0m
