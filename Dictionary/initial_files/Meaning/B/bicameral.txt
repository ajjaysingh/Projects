[91m        SHORT  If your committee has two distinct groups responsible for setting rules and developing policies, then you‚Äôre involved in a bicameral system, meaning that
               there are two separate branches making up the system.[0m
[36m         LONG  You‚Äôve probably noticed the prefix bi- and know that it‚Äôs a tip-off that this word is likely going to describe something that has two parts. You‚Äôre right. The
               word bicameral originates from the Latin bi-, meaning "two," combined with camera, meaning "chamber." Chamber is just another way of referring
               to a legislative branch of a government or other official organization. You‚Äôre probably already familiar with one famous bicameral system: the
               U.S. Congress, which is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.[0m
