[91m        SHORT  An artist well-known for wearing filthy coveralls, or a musician who shares a cheap apartment with eight roommates and a pet monkey might be described as
               bohemian ‚Äî that is, willfully unconventional and nonconformist in both appearance and lifestyle.[0m
[36m         LONG  In the nineteenth century, Romani (Gypsies) living in France were referred to as Boh√©miens because it was thought that they come from the middle-European
               region, Bohemia. The name became attached to artists who moved to low-rent neighborhoods and who seemed to share the outsider status or spirit
               of the Romani. Although bohemian still carries traces of its edgy past, it can now be used to describe a fashion statement ‚Äî such as pairing
               clogs with a floaty peasant blouse.[0m
