[36m         LONG  Any French speaker will recognize that the noun bonhomie is related to bon homme ‚Äî French for "good man." However, a woman can exude a spirit of bonhomie as
               well, as long as she is cheery and kind. If you are looking to infuse a depressing setting with bonhomie, try cracking a joke or setting your
               beret at a rakish angle.[0m
