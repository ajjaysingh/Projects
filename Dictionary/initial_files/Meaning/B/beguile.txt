[36m         LONG  Beguile doesn't always mean that the person or thing beguiling is tricking you, but there is a sense with this word of enchantment that takes away the
               viewer's normal powers of judgment. A beautiful place or idea can beguile as easily as a person. You might be so beguiled by the idea of a
               picnic on the beach that you forgot there are two feet of snow on the ground.[0m
