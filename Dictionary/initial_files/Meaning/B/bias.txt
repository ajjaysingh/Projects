[36m         LONG  Some biases are completely innocent: "I have a bias toward French wines." But most often, bias is used to describe unfair prejudices: "The authorities
               investigated a case involving bias against Latinos." It is also a verb meaning "to show prejudice for or against," as in "They claimed the
               tests were biased against women." (In British English, it takes an extra S in the forms biassed and biassing.) The word goes back at least to
               Old Proven√ßal, a former language of southern France, in association with the sport of lawn bowling, where it referred to the tendency of a ball
               to roll in one direction or the other.[0m
