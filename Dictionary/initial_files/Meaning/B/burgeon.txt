[91m        SHORT  Use the verb burgeon to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may
               burgeon. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon.[0m
[36m         LONG  Although burgeon means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your
               tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning
               career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace.[0m
