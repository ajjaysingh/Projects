[91m        SHORT  A bundle is a package of things wrapped together. To wrap things together in a compact way is to bundle them. A baby wrapped up in a blanket is a bundle of
               joy, and if it‚Äôs cold outside, bundle up![0m
[36m         LONG  Bundle comes from the Middle Dutch word for bind, which is what you do when you bundle stuff ‚Äî you bind it together. It also means to wrap in warm clothes.
               This is a word for things that are tightly packed together. If you get a package in the mail, it's a bundle. If you have knickknacks all over
               the place, you'll need to bundle them when you move by putting them in a box.[0m
