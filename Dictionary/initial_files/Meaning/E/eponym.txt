[91m        SHORT  An eponym is either a person for whom something is named, or a thing named for a person. Jules Leotard, a trapeze artist, inspired the creation of the eponym
               "leotard." Thanks, Jules.[0m
[36m         LONG  Words are formed in many ways: often, they are named after people. For example, the boycott was named after Charles C. Boycott. That makes Boycott an eponym,
               and boycott is also an eponym. Eponyms are the people who provide the names and the words that are formed from the names. St. Audrey is another
               eponym, because her name inspired the word tawdry.[0m
