[91m        SHORT  To enervate is to weaken, wear down, or even bum out. A three-hour lecture on the history of socks might thrill someone, it would enervate most people. So
               would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With your parents.[0m
[36m         LONG  Trace enervate back far enough and you'll discover that it comes from the Latin enervare which means basically ‚Äúto cut the sinew‚Äù or ‚Äúto cause to be cut from
               the muscle.‚Äù That would certainly weaken someone. These days, there‚Äôs no need for violence. To enervate someone is to sap their energy, like by
               reading your ex all the love letters your new sweetheart wrote you. When something enervates you, it does more than get on your nerves; it
               brings you down.[0m
