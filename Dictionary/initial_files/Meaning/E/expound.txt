[91m        SHORT  If given recipe directions that include "some sugar," "some onions," and "some flour" as ingredients, you might ask the cook to expound by adding measurements

[36m         LONG  Expound came into English from a 14th-century French word espondre meaning "to elaborate" or "put forth." Often when you expound something you are clarifying
               or giving the particulars. A more formal way to expound is to offer exposition, often going line by line to explain precise meanings in a text
               or legal document.[0m
