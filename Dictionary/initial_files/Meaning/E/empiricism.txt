[36m         LONG  Empiricism is based on facts, evidence, and research. Scholars and researchers deal in empiricism. If you believe in the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, or
               Santa Claus, you're out of the realm of empiricism — there are no facts to support those myths. If you want to get something practical done, or
               to really know what the deal is with something, empiricism is the way to go.[0m
