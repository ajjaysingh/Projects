[91m        SHORT  If you've read shelves of thick books, people might describe you as a person of erudition.  You might find erudition to be its own reward, but if you can make
               a career of it, even better![0m
[36m         LONG  The Latin root of erudition is the verb erudire which means "to teach or train."  By showing erudition, you show that you've learned a lot.  If you write with
               erudition, your readers will  know that you are a serious scholar, as long as you're not too far over their heads.[0m
