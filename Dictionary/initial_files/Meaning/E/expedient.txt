[91m        SHORT  The adjective expedient describes something that provides an easy way to achieve a goal or result, but it's not necessarily a moral solution.[0m
[36m         LONG  Politically expedient means something you do to advance yourself politically. Use expedient when you want to hint that a particular solution or strategy has
               certain benefits and advantages but is not completely fair. However, expedient can also be used as a noun to describe something practical for
               a particular purpose.[0m
