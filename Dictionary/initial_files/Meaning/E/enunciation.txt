[91m        SHORT  Enunciation is the act of pronouncing words. Make sure your enunciation is clear when ordering in a restaurant so you don’t get French flies instead of French
               fries.[0m
[36m         LONG  Enunciation is from the Latin word enuntiationem, meaning “declaration.” Enunciation is more than pronouncing words clearly; it’s expressing them well, too.
               No one would mutter a declaration! People with excellent enunciation (also known as diction) are likely to end up broadcasters, announcers,
               actors, or in other jobs that require public speaking. Politicians need to have good enunciation. People who mumble or speak too quickly have
               poor enunciation: it's hard to understand them, because their words slur together.[0m

[3m             > Ms. Sumpter’s enunciation has a near-metonymic precision suggestive of Mrs. Obama’s, while Mr. Sawyers’s gestural looseness, playful smile and lanky saunter
