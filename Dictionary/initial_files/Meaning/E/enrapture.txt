[91m        SHORT  To enrapture someone is cast an irresistible spell over them, to make them feel "rapture." I was enraptured by her gorgeous voice and stunning way of

[36m         LONG  When you see the word "rapture," you know you're dealing with a pleasure so great it borders on the divine. The Rapture is, after all, what believers call the
               time when Jesus is meant to return and take them all to Heaven. So when someone enraptures another person, they're creating a feeling of
               wonder, enchantment, and delight that recalls that heavenly feeling. On our first date, I was so enraptured by his charm, humor, and good
               looks, I knew we would spend our lives together.[0m
