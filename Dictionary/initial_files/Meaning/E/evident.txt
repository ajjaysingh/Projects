[91m        SHORT  If something is evident, it's visible. If you blush furiously and start shaking every time your crush comes near, your infatuation will be evident to
               everyone.[0m
[36m         LONG  Evident means conspicuously visible, often the mark of an action or a feeling. If a room is in total disarray, with everything pulled out of the drawers, it's
               evident that someone has been searching for something. If you leave the room in the middle of a tense meeting, your frustration will be
               evident. Evident can also simply mean visible. If you look closely at a key hole of your car door, small scratches will be evident in the
               paint.[0m
