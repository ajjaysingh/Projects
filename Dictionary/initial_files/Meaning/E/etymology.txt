[91m        SHORT  Since you're reading this, then you probably have some interest in etymology, because it's the study of the history and derivations of words.[0m
[36m         LONG  What genealogy is to a family, etymology is to words. A genealogist studies the history of a family. A person who studies etymology does the same thing with
               words. Etymology looks at the roots of words ‚Äî for example, whether they started out as Latin, Greek, or as some other language ‚Äî and how they
               took on their current meaning. When you learn that the -logy part of etymology almost always means "the study of," that is, in itself,
               etymology.[0m
