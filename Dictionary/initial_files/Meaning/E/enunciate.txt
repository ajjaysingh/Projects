[91m        SHORT  Can't get your point across? Maybe you just need to speak more clearly or articulate your thoughts better — in short, enunciate.[0m
[36m         LONG  Good enunciation is similar to pronunciation, but describes more specifically how clearly someone expresses themselves. The word enunciate is related to the
               Latin words for both "announce" and "messenger." So most likely those ancient Romans who created the word wanted a messenger who could announce
               things without mumbling, grumbling, and rambling.[0m
