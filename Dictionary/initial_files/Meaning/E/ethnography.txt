[91m        SHORT  Ethnography is a type of anthropology that involves studying people in a particular society or culture by observing them in their natural setting. A student
               of ethnography might live in Moscow to gather information about Russian marriage practices.[0m
[36m         LONG  First appearing in 1834, the noun ethnography combines the word ethno, meaning "race, culture," and graph, meaning "writing." If you study ethnography, you
               typically collect information through first-hand observation by participating in the society or culture you're studying. For example, as an
               ethnography student you might research the religious practices of an African tribe by living among the tribe members and taking part in their
               rituals and ceremonies.[0m
