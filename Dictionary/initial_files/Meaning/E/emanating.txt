[91m        SHORT  When you use the word emanate, you're usually talking about lights, sounds, or unseen forces coming out of a specific source. If you hear creepy sounds

[36m         LONG  Emanate derives from the Latin e- 'out' and manare to flow. If that last word looks a little like manure to you, you might be interested to know that they're
               not at all related. Thank goodness, too, because the idea of manure flowing out––or emanating––is not something to be discussed in polite
               company.[0m
