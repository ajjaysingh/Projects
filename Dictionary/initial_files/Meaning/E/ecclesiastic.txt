[91m        SHORT  If you’re an ecclesiastic, you probably spend a lot of time in church. The word ecclesiastic describes a member of the clergy, typically someone associated
               with a Christian church.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word ecclesiastic has origins in the Greek word ekklesiastes, meaning "speaker in an assembly or church," and can be used to describe someone associated
               with a church, such as a cleric or a priest. When you see an English word that begins with the eccles bit, you can be pretty sure that its
               meaning will somehow involve religious matters. That’s because ekklēsia is the Greek word for church and it has influenced the spelling of many
               English words of a religious nature, such as ecclesial, ecclesiolatry, and ecclesiarch.[0m
