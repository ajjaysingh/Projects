[91m        SHORT  If you call someone erudite, that means they show great learning. After you've earned your second Ph.D., you will be truly erudite.[0m
[36m         LONG  Erudite is from Latin verb erudire, "to teach," which comes from rudis for "raw, unskilled, ignorant" (the source of our word rude). If you bring someone out
               of a raw state, you educate them, so someone who is erudite is very educated indeed (and perhaps a bit of a showoff).  You can say either ER-
               oo-dite or ER-yoo-dite; the second one, being a bit harder to say, can seem a bit more erudite.[0m
