[36m         LONG  Euphemism is from Greek euphemismos, meaning "good speech," and it's a way that we paper over uncomfortable things with more pleasant-sounding words. These
               days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: toilet, bathroom, and water closet
               were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying "neutralizing the target" instead of "killing
               someone."[0m
