[91m        SHORT  An electorate is a body of people allowed to vote in an election. In the United States, when you turn eighteen, you may join the electorate and help choose a

[36m         LONG  The word electorate is especially important for those people who are not a part of it. For instance, women in the United States were not part of the
               electorate until they were allowed to vote in 1920. Being a part of the electorate is important because it gives you a chance to elect ‚Äî or
               choose ‚Äî who you want to represent you in your government.[0m
