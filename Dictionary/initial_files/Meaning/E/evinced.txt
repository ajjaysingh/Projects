[91m        SHORT  The verb evince means to show or express clearly; to make plain. Evidence can evince the innocence of the accused, and tears can evince the grief of the

[36m         LONG  Evince is a rather formal word that reveals the presence of something hidden ‚Äî usually a feeling. So, if you are happy, your smile might evince your
               happiness. And if you are angry, the skull and crossbones on your tee shirt might evince your anger. Evincing is about expressing. If you are
               keeping your feelings inside, there's not a lot of evincing going on.[0m
