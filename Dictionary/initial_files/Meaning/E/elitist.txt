[36m         LONG  A fairly recent addition to the English language, the noun elitist, came about from a mix of elite + ist in 1950. Carlyle, Freud, and Nietzsche were all
               considered to be the original elitists. Elite, from which elitist was formed, evolved much earlier, in 1823, from the French élite, meaning
               “selection, choice.” Synonyms for elitist include highbrow, pompous person, social climber, and stuffed shirt.[0m
