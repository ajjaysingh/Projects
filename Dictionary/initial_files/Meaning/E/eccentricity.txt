[91m        SHORT  Eccentricity is strange, out-of-the-ordinary, sometimes weirdly attractive behavior or dress. Sleeping with your boots on is pretty normal if you're a cowboy,
               but leaving them on for bedtime in your city apartment, that shows some eccentricity.[0m
[36m         LONG  Eccentricity goes back to the Greek ekkentros, meaning "off center," and when you describe people as being a little "off," you might be talking about their
               eccentricity or behavior that's a bit abnormal. An eccentricity might be some really small character trait, like eating all of the green food
               on your plate first, or a large and very obvious characteristic, as when you ride a donkey to your suburban school instead of taking the bus.[0m
