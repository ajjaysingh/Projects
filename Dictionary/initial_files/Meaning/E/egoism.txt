[91m        SHORT  Someone who is full of himself and doesn't give a darn about other people has a healthy supply of egoism. Egoism means "me me me me me-ism."[0m
[36m         LONG  Egoism has a lot to do with selfishness, which sounds like a bad thing, right? Not necessarily. Some  people think that being selfish is the best thing to do
               for the world as a whole. In other words, if everyone is selfish, everyone will be better off. So egoism can be considered positive or negative
               ‚Äî it all depends how someone uses the word. This makes egoism different from egotism ‚Äî an always yucky type of selfishness.[0m
