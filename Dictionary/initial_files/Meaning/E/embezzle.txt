[91m        SHORT  When a person embezzles, it usually means that he is stealing money from his employer. If he is caught embezzling, it probably also means that he will soon
               be unemployed.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word embezzle implies more than simply "to steal." When a person embezzles, he or she takes advantage of an employer's trust for personal gain.
               Embezzling is a so-called "white-collar crime" which often involves some sort of cover-up, like falsifying financial records or stealing small
               amounts of money over a long period of time. The word embezzle comes from an Old French word meaning "maltreat or ravage," besillier, and an
               embezzler can be said to ravage someone else's money.[0m
