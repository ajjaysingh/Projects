[36m         LONG  Shy kids sometimes need a friend or a teacher who will embolden them to speak up for themselves, and a good grade in a difficult class will embolden a student
               to attempt more challenging courses. When you cheer up a friend or encourage a coworker, you embolden those people. To embolden is "to make
               bold," from the Old English root word beald, which means "brave, confident, or strong."[0m
