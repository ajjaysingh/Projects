[91m        SHORT  Use the verb expropriate to describe the act of taking people's property, usually by a government. If you really like your neighbor's house, you may wish you
               could expropriate the property.[0m
[36m         LONG  To correctly pronounce expropriate, say "ex-PRO-pree-ate." It sounds a lot like another verb, appropriate and has a similar meaning. That's because of their
               shared Latin root proprius, which means "own." Expropriate is typically used to describe taking property ‚Äî rather than smaller possessions ‚Äî
               and a government or other official organization is usually the one doing the taking. For example, a state may expropriate property in order to
               build a new road.[0m
