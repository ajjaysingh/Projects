[91m        SHORT  Does your cupcake have chocolate icing on top, plus chocolate sprinkles AND a swirl of white chocolate? If so, that swirl of white chocolate is considered an
               embellishment ‚Äî an unnecessary decorative detail designed purely to attract you. Also, can we have a bite?[0m
[36m         LONG  Anything can have an embellishment, not just a cupcake; a building can have an unnecessary decorative element, and so can an explanation or a story. There is
               often a sense of deception implied by the word:  it may be a harmless swirl of white chocolate but it can also be a detail designed to fool
               someone. Real estate agents are experts at adding embellishments to their descriptions of properties that may not be entirely true. Watch out
               for embellishments.[0m
