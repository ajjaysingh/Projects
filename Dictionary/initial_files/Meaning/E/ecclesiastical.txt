[91m        SHORT  Anything ecclesiastical is related to the Christian church. An ecclesiastical office is the office at a church, and a nun‚Äôs habit is  ecclesiastical dress. A
               hat with a propeller on top is not.[0m
[36m         LONG  Ecclesiastical things have to do with Christian churches or the clergy. Pews, readings from the Bible, and stained glass windows are all part of the
               ecclesiastical world. The ecclesiastical hierarchy is the pecking order of the clergy. If a politician gets support from a church, that's an
               ecclesiastical endorsement. If you believe in the separation of church and state, you definitely don't want ecclesiastical teachings to inform
               the way laws are made. Secular is the opposite of ecclesiastical.[0m
