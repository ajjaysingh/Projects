[91m        SHORT  Stinky smell coming from under the floor? Weird light from the garden shed at night? That's an emanation, something, often invisible, that is emitted by
               something.[0m
[36m         LONG  Emanation is very similar in meaning to emission, and the two words are often used interchangeably, though there is an important difference; there tends to be
               something slightly more other-worldy and inexplicable about an emanation, owing in part to the word's theological use in the Christian religion
               as a means of describing the Holy Spirit. An emission always has a solid base in reality or science, and an emanation may be just plain spooky.[0m
