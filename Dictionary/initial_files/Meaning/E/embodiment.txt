[91m        SHORT  The embodiment of something gives concrete form to an abstract idea. A flag is the embodiment of a country.[0m
[36m         LONG  When you talk about embodiment, you're talking about giving a form to ideas that are usually not physical: like love, hate, fear, justice, etc. A gavel is the
               embodiment of justice; a wedding ring can be the embodiment of love. The word body in embodiment is a clue to its meaning: this is a word for
               giving a body to things that usually don't have one.[0m
