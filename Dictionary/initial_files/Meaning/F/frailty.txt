[91m        SHORT  Frailty describes a quality that's shared by a sick kitten, an elderly man, and a shoddily built go cart. They all have a delicate weakness or vulnerability
               and seem to require some kind of care.[0m
[36m         LONG  The Old French frailet√©, or "weakness" is the root of frailty, and it in turn comes from the Latin word for "fragile," fragilis. What's interesting is that
               "fragility" was used in the 14th century to mean a kind of moral, rather than physical, weakness. Today frailty can be used this way too, to
               describe a state of having shaky ‚Äî or fragile ‚Äî morals.[0m
