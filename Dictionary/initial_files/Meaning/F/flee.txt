[91m        SHORT  If you bolt, scram, skedaddle, or get the heck of out Dodge, you flee. You run away fast. Don‚Äôt confuse flee with "flea." They sound alike, but the second

[36m         LONG  We get the word flee from Old English fleon. When you flee, you get away as quickly as you can. You might even take flight to escape ‚Äî usually from a
               dangerous place or situation. In a moment of panic after stealing a cookie from the cookie jar, you might decide to flee the scene of the
               crime.[0m
