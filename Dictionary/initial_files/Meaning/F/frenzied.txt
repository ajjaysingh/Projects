[91m        SHORT  The adjective frenzied describes something wild, excited, or rushed. You may have a frenzied morning when you've overslept and need to get lunches made, the
               dog walked, and the kids off to school within the next fifteen minutes. Run![0m
[36m         LONG  Frenzied is from the word frenzy, which itself is from the Latin word phreneticus, meaning "delirious." Words related to frenzied include frantic and
               frenetic, but frenzied isn't necessarily bad. If you're a rock star, you may enjoy a frenzied crowd at your concerts, and you feed off the
               energy and adoration you get from them. If it's your first time on stage, however, that same frenzied crowd may send you into a panic.[0m
