[36m         LONG  You can use the verb fledge in several ways ‚Äî first, to describe what happens when a bird's feathers grow in. A mother bird ‚Äî or human ‚Äî who cares for and
               raises a young bird can also be said to fledge it. You can also talk about the process of putting feathers on something, especially a hunting
               arrow, this way: "Once you fledge the arrow, you can use it with your bow." The Old English root word is flycge, "having feathers, or fit to
               fly."[0m
