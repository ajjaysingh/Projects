[91m        SHORT  When a mother loses her child, she's frantic. She's a crazed sort of agitated and goes on a frantic search for her child. A scene is frantic if there's lots
               of action with little order.[0m
[36m         LONG  Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were stark raving mad.
               Today, frantic implies fast wild movements or a desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the mall was frantic with
               shoppers desperately searching for their last few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police were called and everyone
               rushed to get away.[0m
