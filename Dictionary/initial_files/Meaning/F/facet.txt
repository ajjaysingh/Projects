[91m        SHORT  A facet is one side or aspect of something. If you‚Äôre thinking about quitting your day job to become a circus performer, you should first consider every facet

[36m         LONG  Facet, which is related to the word face, can also refer to one of the flat ‚Äúfaces‚Äù of a diamond or other gem. This was the word‚Äôs original definition, and it
               was evidently seen as an apt metaphor for one side of a complex idea. When a problem has many parts to consider (or when it‚Äôs just a huge
               mess), you can describe it as multifaceted.[0m
