[91m        SHORT  Fraught means filled with something ‚Äî often something bad. Your Thanksgiving was fraught with awkward moments when your family saw your blue hair, and it only

[36m         LONG  Fraught is related to the word freight, and comes from the Middle English fraughten, meaning "to load with cargo." Think of a cargo ship loaded up with
               freight for a journey ‚Äî it's full of supplies, just like Thanksgiving was filled with ‚Äî or fraught with ‚Äî awkward moments. Fraught can also
               describe a situation filled with distress. If relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting along with each other.[0m
