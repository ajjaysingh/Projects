[91m        SHORT  To be fiendish is to be cruel or evil. You might choose not to watch horror films ‚Äî or soap operas ‚Äî if you're not a fan of seeing people do fiendish things
               to each other.[0m
[36m         LONG  Fiendish behavior is terrible and vicious, and fiendish people behave without kindness or conscience. An informal, less serious way to use the adjective is to
               mean "complicated or difficult." You might, for example, describe your fiendish calculus exam or rave about the fiendish plot in your favorite
               book. Fiendish comes from fiend, "evil spirit," with its Old English root feogan, "to hate."[0m
