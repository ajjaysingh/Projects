[91m        SHORT  You know how you feel when you can‚Äôt open a jar of pickles? And then grandma walks in and does it in one shot without even grunting? That‚Äôs called feeling

               are nothing compared to the guy who makes feeble attempts at humor. Lame-o jokes are way more lamentable than inadequate biceps.[0m
