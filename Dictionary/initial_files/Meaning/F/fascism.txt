[91m        SHORT  Fascism is a way of ruling that advocates total control of the people. Your parents' rule that you must be home by midnight might seem like fascism, but
               Europeans will tell you that it could be a lot worse.[0m
[36m         LONG  The word fascism can be hard to spell, so remember that the c comes after the s. Fascism comes from the Latin fascio, meaning “bundle, or political group.” In
               fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force. There’s no option to
               vote, no chance to impeach a leader, and no freedom to stand up against the governing body.[0m
