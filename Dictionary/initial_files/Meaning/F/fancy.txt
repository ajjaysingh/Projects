[91m        SHORT  Fancy can be an adjective, noun, or a verb. As an adjective, it‚Äôs the opposite of plain. The noun names something that isn‚Äôt real. When someone likes or wants
               something, the verb can be used: ‚ÄúI fancy a cup of tea.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt that sound fancy?[0m
[36m         LONG  Fancy is an old contraction of the word fantasy. You‚Äôll often see this word used in the phrase ‚Äúflights of fancy.‚Äù This phrase refers to an unrealistic goal
               or idea such as, ‚ÄúHe has flights of fancy about running off to Hollywood and becoming a movie star.‚Äù Fancy can also be used as an expression of
