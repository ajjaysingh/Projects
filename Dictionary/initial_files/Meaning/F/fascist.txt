[91m        SHORT  If you know someone who's a fascist, that person is probably into control. A fascist is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian
               views and a strong central government — and no tolerance for opposing opinions.[0m
[36m         LONG  Fascist traces to the Italian word fascio, meaning "group, bundle." Under fascist rule, the emphasis is on the group — the nation — with few individual
               rights. You must support the ruling party's views on society, politics, and culture — or else. The term was used by Italian political leader
               Benito Mussolini under his totalitarian, anti-communist government. The word can describe someone who supports fascism — or whose behavior is
               so stern and controlling that it seems like he does.[0m
