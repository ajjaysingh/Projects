[91m        SHORT  Something flagrant is bad ‚Äî so bad you can't ignore it. A flagrant foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a flagrant violation of the law might send
               you to the slammer.[0m
[36m         LONG  The current meaning of the adjective flagrant ‚Äî "obviously offensive or disgraceful" ‚Äî is thought to derive from the Latin legal term in flagrante delicto,
               which literally meant "with fire still blazing" and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed.
               Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad ‚Äî like flagrant bad taste or
               flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar.[0m
