[91m        SHORT  A farce is a broad satire or comedy, though now it's used to describe something that is supposed to be serious but has turned ridiculous. If a defendant is
               not treated fairly, his lawyer might say that the trial is a farce.[0m
[36m         LONG  As a type of comedy, a farce uses improbable situations, physical humor and silliness to entertain. Spoof films such as "Spaceballs," a comedy based on the
               Star Wars movies, are farces. If a real-life event or situation is a farce, it feels this ridiculous. An election is a farce, if the outcome
               has been determined before the voting begins. And class can feel like a farce if your substitute teacher knows less about the subject than you
               do.[0m
