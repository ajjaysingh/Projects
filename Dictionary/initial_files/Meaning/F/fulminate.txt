[36m         LONG  The word fulminate is made up of the Latin root fulmen meaning "lightning flash." Look up at the sky during a violent thunderstorm and chances are you'll
               catch thunder and lightning fulminate or explode loudly and violently overhead. But you needn't look to the sky alone for this kind of
               intensity. If you find yourself in a room with passionate Republicans and Democrats debating, you might see them fulminate or severely rail
               against each other's beliefs.[0m
