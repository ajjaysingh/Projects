[91m        SHORT  If something is limp, loose, droopy, and wrinkly, you can call it flaccid, which rhymes with "acid." Think elephant skin, soggy asparagus, and the type of
               feeble handshakes frowned on in job interviews.[0m
[36m         LONG  We get the word flaccid from the Latin flaccus, which meant "flabby." The meaning is pretty much the same today, though it applies to  more than physical
               flab. Flaccid pops up in conversation to describe lackluster leadership, dull conversation, and even feeble attempts at word definitions. If a
               politician's election campaign is flaccid, it will surprise no one that he only receives two votes ‚Äî one from his grandmother and the other
               from someone who accidentally checked the wrong box on the ballot.[0m
