[91m        SHORT  When you see your mom come back from the salon with bright green spiky hair and your jaw drops to the floor in total shock, you‚Äôre flabbergasted. You are
               really, really shocked ‚Äî pretty much speechless.[0m
[36m         LONG  Use the adjective flabbergasted to describe someone who's astounded or surprised for any reason, good or bad. You could be flabbergasted at how astonishingly
               expensive a parking ticket is, or at how incredibly delicious pineapple pizza is. Flabbergasted has been used since the late 18th century, but
               no one knows for sure where it originated. The word sounds like what it means: when you say it out loud ‚Äî "flabbergasted!" ‚Äî it somehow
               captures the spirit of astonishment and shock.[0m
