[91m        SHORT  If you‚Äôre taking flak, chances are you‚Äôre in a bad situation and taking fire from an enemy. Flak can refer to criticism ‚Äî or worse, shots from an airplane.[0m
[36m         LONG  Flak came into English as an abbreviation for the German word Fliegerabwehrkanone, meaning 'aircraft-defense gun.' (Yikes! No wonder they abbreviated it.) If
               you‚Äôre dealing with a lot of flak, you‚Äôre either in a fighter plane over enemy territory drawing shots, or you‚Äôre dealing with a volley of
               criticism that seems like antiaircraft fire. If you show up late for work for a third day, you‚Äôll probably take some flak from your coworkers ‚Äî
               they‚Äôll take verbal shots at you.[0m
