[91m        SHORT  A fleet is usually a large group of ships, but it can be any group of vessels like planes or cars that operate as a unit. A naval fleet is the largest
               formation of warships. A naval fleet at sea is like an army on land.[0m
[36m         LONG  One meaning of fleet comes from the Old English fleot, meaning ‚Äúship,‚Äù ‚Äúraft,‚Äù or ‚Äúfloating vessel.‚Äù Although a fleet is usually a group of ships or airplanes
               operating under the same ownership, any group of vessels sailing together can be called a fleet, even you and your friends in a fleet of
               kayaks. Another meaning of fleet originates in the Old English flƒìotan, which means ‚Äúmoving swiftly.‚Äù When it‚Äôs used in that way, it‚Äôs usually
               in the -ing form, fleeting.[0m
