              	What is  an 'Instant  History Bias ' An inaccuracy in the appearance of investment fund returns that occurs when only new, successful funds report their
               numbers while new, unsuccessful funds close and their poor returns aren't factored into an investment manager's or investment type's overall
               performance record.
