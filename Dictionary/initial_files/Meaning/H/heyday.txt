[36m         LONG  If you remember a time in the past when you were doing something really well or getting a lot of attention or fame, you might be reminiscing about your
               heyday. A person or an organization ‚Äî and even a thing ‚Äî can have a heyday, or a peak time when everything goes well. The good news is that a
               heyday can come again and again, so while your heyday as student president might be just a memory, there might be a heyday as governor of your
