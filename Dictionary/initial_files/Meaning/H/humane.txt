[36m         LONG  The idea of being humane is linked to a higher level of a person's character. While the word is derived from the word human, the sad fact is that a person can
               be human without being humane. Britain's Royal Humane Society, created in 1774 to rescue drowning people, focuses on recognizing acts of human
               bravery. In the United States, however, the Humane Society works to eliminate cruelty to animals. Still, both focus on kindness and the humane
               care of others.[0m
