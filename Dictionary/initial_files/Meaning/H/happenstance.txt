[36m         LONG  Happenstance is a combination of the words, happen and circumstance. Whereas circumstances are the conditions that surround an event, happenstance is the
               event itself. If you have no food at home so you go out to eat and sit next to a charming person who you end up marrying, your meeting was
               happenstance and your being hungry and having no food at home were the circumstances.[0m
