[36m         LONG  There are plenty of nonbelievers, but a heathen is something more ‚Äî someone who is actively offensive to a religion. The term is tied to the Gods of Judaism,
               Christianity and Islam; someone who rejects the various gods of Hinduism, for example, is not likely to be called a heathen. Heathens are
               sometimes called infidels and pagans. These days, the term is often used humorously. An atheist might jokingly refer to herself as a heathen.[0m
