[91m        SHORT  Hypodermic is a medical term that refers to anything related to just under the skin. A hypodermic needle injects medicine into your veins.[0m
[36m         LONG  The prefix hypo- means "under," while the Latin word derma refers to "skin." You might remember this easily by thinking about the word dermatologist, which is
               a doctor who deals with skin issues. Hypodermic is also a noun that refers to a syringe, or needle, that pierces beneath the skin. As an
               adjective, hypodermic means anything that relates to or is found below the skin, like a hypodermic bruise.[0m
