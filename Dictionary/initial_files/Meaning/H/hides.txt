[91m        SHORT  You can hide your feelings or you can hide your mom’s birthday present. You can even hide yourself if you need to avoid someone. Whatever it is, when you hide
               something, you put it out of sight.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hide can mean that you keep something secret, like the way you really feel about your dad’s meatloaf. You can also hide something physical. If you spill juice
               on your white sofa, you can hide the stain with a pillow. Sometimes people hide also — that means the person stays out of sight. A bankrobber
               will hide from the police, or you might hide from your mom to avoid doing the dishes.[0m
