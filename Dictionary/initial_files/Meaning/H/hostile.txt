[91m        SHORT  If something is hostile, it's unfriendly. If you are zealous about the political causes you believe in, you will be hostile to any suggestion that the other
               side of the argument is reasonable.[0m
[36m         LONG  Hostile comes from the Latin word hostis, for enemy, and you can hear its relation to the word hostage.  But you don't have to be from a warring nation to be
               hostile. You can talk about a hostile nation, a hostile takeover, a hostile remark, or a hostile attitude. Some synonyms are inimical,
               antagonistic, unfavorable, unfriendly.[0m
