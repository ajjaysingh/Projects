[36m         LONG  Hustle comes from the Dutch word for "shake" or "toss." As a noun, a hustle is a busy, hurried scene, like the hustle of the subway at rush hour. We also call
               the act of swindling a hustle, because it happens so fast. As a verb, hustle can either mean to swindle someone or to hurry them, or to work
               hard. You can hustle someone out the door. If you hustle, you can earn good tips as a waiter.[0m
